         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62941:3"/>after I had waited Å¿everal dayes and found that notwithÅ¿tanding anguiÅ¿h and torment were upon you, who in your conÅ¿ciences were Å¿mitten and wounded, Å¿o that Å¿ome durÅ¿t not read my book, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ently returned it; others beginning to read, could not, but laid it aÅ¿ide, others reading it, Å¿hed more tears, then they read lines, (as themÅ¿elves have Å¿aid) and yet againÅ¿t it hardened themÅ¿elves, and repented not: And others reading it, and reproved by it, fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to much rage and fury, and therein publiÅ¿hing it themÅ¿elves amongÅ¿t their rude companions, endeavouring to raiÅ¿e lies and falÅ¿ehood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t it. I Å¿ay, when theÅ¿e and Å¿uch like effects appeared, and not till then, I conÅ¿ented to the making my books publick, by which I perceive the Å¿ence of guilt, and Å¿o of torment being encreaÅ¿ed, you grew exceeding angry and wrathful: But if ye had Å¿tood in that which convinced, its like I had no longer, in publick view conteÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauÅ¿e I do neither deÅ¿ire, nor endeavour your deÅ¿truction, but your Å¿alvation (God is witneÅ¿s.) Neither in a Å¿pirit of anger and bitterneÅ¿s am I dealing with you, whoÅ¿e welfare I am Å¿eeking, not your hurt: But in the fear of the Lord am I faithfully dealing with you, (of whoÅ¿e Å¿tate and condition I am not ignorant) not daring to uÅ¿e flattering and deceitful Å¿peeches, as others do, crying peace and Å¿afety to that againÅ¿t which (I know) the wrath and righteous judgement of God is near to be revealed; but in much plainneÅ¿s, in a Å¿pirit of Å¿oberneÅ¿s and moderation do I tell you the truth, and (whether ye will hear or forbear) the time is at hand in which ye muÅ¿t witneÅ¿s it, notwithÅ¿tanding (to hide your Å¿elves and cover your Å¿hame) ye are Å¿triving to recover your Vail, and vindicate your Å¿elves: And (having given heed to many falÅ¿e Å¿educing and lying Å¿pirits) ye have writen a book for that purpoÅ¿e, which I received from you by the hand of a Å¿tranger, Å¿uppoÅ¿ing the conÅ¿cience ye had of the deceit and falÅ¿hood ye therein uÅ¿ed Å¿o far prevailed, that none among your Å¿elves could appear to deliver it.

And do ye not by this juÅ¿tifie the guilty betrayer and condemn the innocent betrayed one? How well may the paÅ¿Å¿ers by (as ye Å¿ay) clap their hands and wag their heads, and Å¿ay is this a Church that men call an aÅ¿Å¿embly of <hi>Zion?</hi> And are theÅ¿e your gathered Churches, about which there hath been Å¿o much contending?

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62941:15"/>Coppy delivered to me by <hi>Robert SimpÅ¿on,</hi> which he Å¿aith is true, and ye <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ãâã</desc>
               </gap> teÅ¿timony he is faithful, it is thus, <hi>Your Å¿peaking reproachfully of the pretious Scriptures of truth, as firÅ¿t, affirming, that it was a blind to Å¿ouls, and Å¿econdly, one of the greateÅ¿t plagues of the Land, and thirdly, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming farther, that it is not the Word of God, nor rule of life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let the Reader, whoÅ¿e eye is opened, judge how theÅ¿e agree, The perÅ¿on Å¿ent to admoniÅ¿h at the Å¿ame time or thereahouts, gives it under his hand, that what he writ out, and delivered to me, was a true Coppy of what he received. And the whole company, after they received an anÅ¿wer thereunto, deviÅ¿eth and publiÅ¿heth another, and Å¿ay it is <hi>verbatim,</hi> though it much differs from the former: The latter Å¿aith, the charge there mentioned was <hi>verbatim,</hi> in theÅ¿e words, <hi>Speaking reproachfully of the bleÅ¿Å¿ed Scriptures, affirming they were blind, and a plague to Å¿ouls,</hi> &amp;c. the former in theÅ¿e words, <hi>Speaking reproachfully of the precious Scripture of truth,</hi> as firÅ¿t affirming that it was a blind to Å¿ouls, and aly. one of the greateÅ¿t plagues of the land; The one puts both together, <hi>The Scripture is blind and a plague,</hi> the other divides them into two particulars, and Å¿aith firÅ¿t, <hi>a blind to Å¿ouls,</hi> and 2ly. <hi>one of the greateÅ¿t plagues of the Land;</hi> the one, that <hi>the Scriptures were blind,</hi> the other, <hi>that it is a blind,</hi> the one, that <hi>they were blind,</hi> and <hi>a plague to Å¿ouls,</hi> and never mentions the <hi>Land;</hi> The other, that it is firÅ¿t, <hi>a blind to Å¿ouls,</hi> and 2ly. <hi>a plague;</hi> yea, <hi>one of the greateÅ¿t plagues of the Land,</hi> and mentions not Å¿ouls: The one Å¿aith, <hi>The pretious Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of truth,</hi> The other, <hi>the bleÅ¿Å¿ed Scriptures,</hi> and mentions not the words <hi>(of truth)</hi> And yet if any man is given over to believe lies, ye will perÅ¿wade him all this is true and <hi>verbatim,</hi> that is, word for word, according to the copy. And that (notwithÅ¿tanding this lying Å¿pirit, which is found in your mouths, to which ye give heed; ye are a Church of ChriÅ¿t, or a myÅ¿tical body (a word of deceit from the bottomleÅ¿Å¿e pit) which may be Å¿ubject to this Å¿pirit, as it plainly appears to all beholders, ye are by what your Å¿elves have publiÅ¿hed. And truly the day hath manifeÅ¿ted you very much, and ye cannot be hid but by the light your deeds of darkneÅ¿Å¿e are and will be reproved, and your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended admonition farther manifeÅ¿ted to be but Å¿tudied accuÅ¿ations, <hi>and from your father the devil, who was a liar from the beginning, and abode not in the truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as that which ye call your admonition, and Å¿ay ye did inÅ¿ert <hi>verbatim</hi> as a bundle of lies and confuÅ¿ion as hath been manifeÅ¿ted, Å¿o is that which ye call your proof; for in page 13. ye Å¿ay <hi>becauÅ¿e I Å¿aid thoÅ¿e things (that is to Å¿ay your charge) are Å¿tudied accuÅ¿ations, and from the father of lies, &amp;c. ye Å¿hall therefore prove every tittle to be true.</hi> And in page 18. ye Å¿ay <hi>ye have proved every tittle to be true and clear;</hi> and in page 26. your 3 MeÅ¿Å¿engers who boaÅ¿t that they received their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿Å¿ion from God to this work, Å¿ay <hi>that the things that they charged me withall are all true in every Å¿illable of it, as doth appear by the foregoing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wer of the whole Church.</hi> Now then if ye have not proved every tittle of your charge to be true, and if it do not appear by your foregoing
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62941:16"/>anÅ¿wer, that every Å¿illable of that with which your MeÅ¿Å¿engers charged me is true, then are ye proved (both thoÅ¿e that did Å¿end, and thoÅ¿e that were Å¿ent) no Church of ChriÅ¿t, but a company of lyars and falÅ¿e aÅ¿Å¿erters. But ye have not proved every title, and every Å¿illa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thereof to be true, and therefore are ye no Church of ChriÅ¿t, but a company of lyars, for firÅ¿t ye charged me for leaving the Church, and now ye Å¿ay, that I have left the Church is true, but no proof thereof have ye given, neither is it true which ye Å¿ay, for the Church I have not left, but to witneÅ¿s the Church I have left the harlot, and that I have abÅ¿olutely forÅ¿aken, left and renounced fellowÅ¿hip with you in all your idolatrous heatheniÅ¿h wayes and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hips which Å¿tand in the will and time of man, and not in the will and power of God; and by the mighty arm and power of the Lord am I Å¿eparated from amongÅ¿t you, never again to have fellowÅ¿hip, nor communion with you, in thoÅ¿e unfruitful works of darkneÅ¿s, which by the light are reproved, is granted, elÅ¿e could I never know nor witneÅ¿s the Church of ChriÅ¿t which is in God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: But that ye are the Church of ChriÅ¿t is denyed and was deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and by your fruits, and what lodged in you were ye proved an harlot, a Å¿ynagogue of Satan, &amp;c. which Å¿tands vvholly unanÅ¿vvered by you. And therefore it is not true, but a lie, to Å¿ay I left the Church, when I was Å¿eparated from the Harlot, that I might witneÅ¿s the Church. But Å¿uppoÅ¿e it had been true, that I had left the Church, by vvhat have ye proved it? Why onely your Å¿elves Å¿ay it is Å¿o, but that is no proof, and yet this is more than tittles and Å¿yllables, it is vvhole Å¿entences, ye a general charge not proved, except vvhat the harlot Å¿peaks (to Å¿ave her head, vvhen to judgement Å¿he is brought) is to be believed and admitted as a proof.</p>
            <p>But ye go on and Å¿ay, <hi>that my Å¿o doing hath drawn away Å¿ome, grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved others, and opened the mouehs of many to Å¿peak evil of the wayes of ChriÅ¿t which is clear, and plain, and not a Å¿tudied accuÅ¿ation, but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al thing, which hath been grief, and Å¿adneÅ¿s to the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I reply if the Harlot or Synagogue of Satan, might be believed in her own caÅ¿e, when Å¿he Å¿peaks not truth, then what ye Å¿ay were of Å¿ome value. But from the Church have I drawn none, nor been a grief, nor Å¿adneÅ¿s (that I know) to her, with whom in Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure I have unity. Neither do I know of any whoÅ¿e mouths I have juÅ¿tly opened, to Å¿peak evil! of the wayes of ChriÅ¿t which are pure and Å¿piritual; So that the whoriÅ¿h and adulterous harlot cannot Å¿ee it, who is grieved and Å¿adned at my departure, whoÅ¿e judgement is come and her torments from the living God are pouring, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath Å¿he opened her mouth very wide, and from her unclean fountain and Å¿pirit of envie is pouring out of Å¿toods of reviling &amp; bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes, not onely when Å¿he aÅ¿Å¿embles in her harlots houÅ¿es, and Idol Temples with the reÅ¿t of the proud and perÅ¿ecuting World, where the Churches of ChriÅ¿t after they were gathered did never aÅ¿Å¿emble, but in her books and pamphlets Å¿peaking evil as Å¿he can, not only of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62941:16"/>the Church &amp; ways of ChriÅ¿t, which Å¿he underÅ¿tands not, but of ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us himÅ¿elf who is come a light into the World, ane is the light of the World, which hath enlightned every man that cometh into the World, and this is clear and plain, and no Å¿tudied accuÅ¿ation, but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al thing and her proper Å¿entence juÅ¿tly due is gone forth from the preÅ¿ence of the Lord, and over her head doth Å¿tand.</p>
            <p>And notvvithÅ¿tanding ye Å¿ay, <hi>I</hi> gave no vvord or reaÅ¿on of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, the Å¿ober ChriÅ¿tian ye mention will eaÅ¿ily perceive that this is another refuge of lies, for it was reaÅ¿on enough of my departure, to deny you to be a Church of ChriÅ¿t, and to prove you an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, a Synagogue of Satan, a cage &amp;c. And all this I have done not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withÅ¿tanding ye bluÅ¿h not to Å¿ay I gave no reaÅ¿on of my departure, &amp;c. But <hi>I</hi> perceive that which troubles you is that I who Å¿o well knew you, and was Å¿o long as an Elder amongÅ¿t you; whom ye did Å¿o often chuÅ¿e and elect to that employment; and Å¿o highly eÅ¿teemed, Å¿hould now Å¿o Å¿adly apoÅ¿tatize (as ye call it) as not to acknowledge you a Church.</p>
            <p>To which I reply, Were ye indeed a Church of ChriÅ¿t, how glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would I acknowledge ye? But till ye prove your Å¿elves Å¿o, I may (in the words of <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> to <hi>Ralph Farmer,</hi> in the 60 page of your book) tell you, <hi>though you be Å¿o wiÅ¿e to propoÅ¿e, I cannot be Å¿o fooliÅ¿h as to grant it, leÅ¿t I make my Å¿elfe a tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿or like unto you, and rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t the light, which hath manifeÅ¿ted you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now let me demand your proof; for although ye Å¿ay, <hi>ye would prove every tittle, and had proved every tittle of what ye charged me withal,</hi> yet is here no proof at all produced to prove that I drew any from the Church, grieved and Å¿adned many, or opened the mouths of any, to Å¿peak evill of the wayes of ChriÅ¿t, yet is this more than a tittle or a Å¿yllable, it is many words and Å¿entences.</p>
            <p>Oh fooliÅ¿h people and unwiÅ¿e! how hath the Devill, the god of the world, and Rulers of the darkneÅ¿Å¿e blinded you? why, is there no feare of God before your eyes? who are adding one iniquity to another, as drunkenneÅ¿Å¿e to thirÅ¿t, and yet beÅ¿peak your Å¿elves a Church. And becauÅ¿e ye have recovered a veile, with which your Å¿elves are blinded, do think all others muÅ¿t be veiled too; but where ChriÅ¿t is witneÅ¿Å¿ed, the veile is removed, and in the light of ChriÅ¿t, which ye have deÅ¿piÅ¿ed, and Å¿et at nought, are ye Å¿een and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and your hypocriÅ¿ies, inventions and traditions, will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hips, carnall ordinances, together with that lying Å¿pirit, to which ye give heed, are in the Å¿ame light judged, denyed, and witneÅ¿Å¿ed againÅ¿t as that which to the Lord is abominable, and burthenÅ¿ome, in which he hath no delight, but his Å¿oule hates becauÅ¿e it is iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and a loathÅ¿ome thing (<hi>IÅ¿a.</hi> 1.16.)</p>
            <p>But from you whom have I drawn away? Why had ye not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned one that Å¿ome colour of truth might appear? or that by it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿o ye might be reproved, who of the Å¿trong and mighty arme and power of the Lord are ignorant, by which he hath powerfully drawn
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62941:17"/>and gathered many from amongÅ¿t you (as well as from others who in the like deceit, are worÅ¿hipping they know not what) into his moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of holineÅ¿Å¿e, which he in this his day is Å¿etting up, and eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over your heads, and a top of all mountains, in which to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the Lord is making a feaÅ¿t of fat things, of which thoÅ¿e that pour out a drink offering to that number, muÅ¿t not eat; in which moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Veile is removed, the Å¿hadows taken away, no Lyon or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall devouring beaÅ¿tly thing can ever come; but in it is the way of holineÅ¿Å¿e known and witneÅ¿Å¿ed, and life, light and immortality reigns for evermore, and the true and living God, in Å¿pirit, life and power, known and worÅ¿hipped, who is light, and in whom there is no dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e at all. And Å¿o, although groÅ¿s darkneÅ¿Å¿e hath overÅ¿pread the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> land, where the Diviners, the Sorcerers, the TaskmaÅ¿ters and oppreÅ¿Å¿ors dwell, yet in <hi>Jacobs</hi> Tent there is light, by which the deeds of darkneÅ¿Å¿e are Å¿een and reproved: And therefore although ye have taken liberty to vent your lies and Å¿launders, and falÅ¿e accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ations againÅ¿t the innocent, over your high places, when ye aÅ¿Å¿em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by troops in harlots houÅ¿es, where the children of light dare not come to reproove and gainÅ¿ay it, except they are thereunto power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully moved of the Lord, to teÅ¿tifie againÅ¿t your deceipt and abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination: Yet muÅ¿t ye learn wiÅ¿dome, and take heed of printing and publiÅ¿hing Å¿uch Å¿tuffe to the world, elÅ¿e may ye be Å¿ure, whilÅ¿t ye Å¿eek to cover it with a veile, your iniquities will be marked, your filthy Å¿epulchre opened (which is already but badly painted) your skirts more diÅ¿covered, Å¿o that Å¿hame and confuÅ¿ion will be your por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for evermore, except ye repent: And therefore of this be ye warned.</p>
            <p>In your third branch ye lay the charge thus, viz. <hi>your extream cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oriouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, and raÅ¿h judging, not onely of perÅ¿ons abroad, but alÅ¿o of the Church,</hi> &amp;c. And tell the world ye will prove (yea that ye have proved) every tittle and Å¿yllable of theÅ¿e things to be true, when ye have not endeavoured Å¿o much as a Å¿hew of proof for ought ye Å¿peak touching perÅ¿ons abroad, but paÅ¿t it over as if ye had never Å¿poken it: And yet this is tittles and Å¿yllables, yea words, &amp;c. But a bridle for your tongue ye want, who have Å¿o long given heed to lying Å¿pirits, that now ye appear to love lying, more then to Å¿peak truth, and (being out of the fear of the Lord) Å¿peak ye care not what.</p>
            <p>I come now to your fifth branch, and Å¿hall not trouble my Å¿elfe again with thoÅ¿e many lies, falÅ¿hoods, and contradictions which I there finde in what you Å¿ay is <hi>verbatim,</hi> having mentioned Å¿ome of them before, but Å¿hall examine your proof of that alÅ¿o, and Å¿ee if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very tittle of it be proved, or whether ye may not be proved lyars in this, as in the reÅ¿t.</p>
            <p>Ye Å¿ay, <hi>I did at a meeting at mine houÅ¿e affirme the firÅ¿t part of this branch,</hi> viz. <hi>That the Scriptures were blinde, and a plague to Å¿ouls:</hi> And for proof, ye again produce your own Å¿aying, <hi>it is Å¿o,</hi> and that Å¿ome of you Å¿itting over againÅ¿t me, do well remember how I Å¿pake it,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62941:17"/>
               <hi>Clapping my hand upon the book or table,</hi> Å¿aying, <hi>That Book or Scriptures was one of the greateÅ¿t blindes and plagues to mens Å¿ouls this day in England. And that ye will again affirme, and Å¿et your hands to it that I Å¿pake thoÅ¿e very words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I Å¿ay, There was a time in which many falÅ¿e witneÅ¿Å¿es were brought againÅ¿t him who was the truth and the light, but they agreed not. And when by the truth ye are examined, it will be found, that ye alÅ¿o are far from agreeing in teÅ¿timony; for proving what your Å¿elves affirme, if your own teÅ¿timony were admitted in your own caÅ¿e, which it is not. Ye Å¿ay, <hi>ye will again affirme, and Å¿et your hands to it, that I Å¿pake thoÅ¿e very words.</hi> And what words are they? Not the Å¿ame in the charge, which ye Å¿ay is <hi>verbatim,</hi> but is much otherwiÅ¿e, and Å¿o the charge is fall'n and falÅ¿e, as the Reader may Å¿ee: And who are they that will affirme and Å¿et their hands to it? Are they the whole company, or but a part? If it be the whole, then many or moÅ¿t of you will affirme and Å¿et your hands to that which themÅ¿elves have confeÅ¿t they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard: If it be but a part, and not the whole, then that which yee have already Å¿aid, is altogether falÅ¿e, and untrue, and your teÅ¿timony invalid: For what is Å¿aid, is Å¿aid by the whole, or elÅ¿e thoÅ¿e that Å¿igned it, are in this, as in other things, abhominable lyars.</p>
            <p>Again, in what ye Å¿ay ye will affirme, and Å¿et your hands unto, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears much uncertainty; for ye Å¿ay, <hi>I clapt my hand on the book or table,</hi> but on which I perceive ye are ignorant: And ye Å¿ay <hi>I Å¿aid that booke or Scripture.</hi> Now if ye Å¿o well remember the manner of Å¿peech, as ye Å¿ay ye doe, it is much ye cannot remember the matter. But having before accuÅ¿ed me for Å¿aying <hi>the Scriptures were a blinde to Å¿oules, and a plague to the Land.</hi> Now ye Å¿ay, <hi>It was, the booke or Scriptures that I Å¿aid was one of the greateÅ¿t blindes and plagues to mens Å¿oules this day in</hi> England. ManifeÅ¿ting your Å¿elves to be at a loÅ¿Å¿e and in confuÅ¿ion, not able to Å¿ay, whether it were the Book or the Scriptures, or what it was, for indeed it was neither: And Å¿o the charge or accuÅ¿ation is quite fallen, and by your Å¿elves brought to nought.</p>
            <p>And why are theÅ¿e words, viz. <hi>one of the greateÅ¿t plagues,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in England,</hi> now added? being left out in the place where ye Å¿ay ye did inÅ¿ert <hi>verbatim:</hi> Is here no deÅ¿igned Å¿ubtilty and deceipt? Is all proved? Are here no tittles, nor Å¿yllables neglected in the proof? Or is what ye have publiÅ¿hed like to be true, or fit to be believed? Let the Reader conÅ¿ider it.</p>
            <p>But ye Å¿ay, <hi>Å¿ome of you</hi> Å¿itting over againÅ¿t me (it's like, at the Table) do well remember, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But why had ye not told me, who theÅ¿e <hi>Å¿ome</hi> were that Å¿ate over againÅ¿t me, and do remember it? For I know but four that were wont to Å¿it with me at the Table, and with three of them have I Å¿poken, neither of which could to my face Å¿ay or affirme, they ever heard me Å¿peak Å¿uch things, and then the <hi>Å¿ome</hi> is but one, and that is an <hi>hireling</hi> too, a Diviner, a deceitful worker, that daubeth with untempered morter, and cries peace, peace, to that to which the Lord Å¿peaks no peace, and his teÅ¿timony is little worth; for if ye Å¿ay he Å¿ate over againÅ¿t me at the Table, when I Å¿pake Å¿uch words, <hi>Jane Frye</hi> contradicts him, who is the only perÅ¿on beÅ¿ides himÅ¿elf, that ever I heard, or could learn, had the Å¿hameleÅ¿Å¿e confidence to Å¿ay, Å¿he heard me Å¿peak theÅ¿e things, with whom I had conference in the preÅ¿ence of other witneÅ¿Å¿e, and demanded where it was Å¿poke, Å¿he replyed, <hi>in mine owne houÅ¿e at a meeting;</hi> I cold her it
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62941:18"/>was much many others heard it not as well as Å¿he. To which Å¿he replyed, <hi>it was after the meeting was done, and I was riÅ¿en from the Table, and Å¿tood out in the roome, and there clapt my hand on the Booke, and Å¿pake as before.</hi> And that her Å¿elfe, with her Å¿iÅ¿ter <hi>HaÅ¿Å¿ard,</hi> and her Å¿iÅ¿ter <hi>Anne Davis,</hi> went out into the Å¿treets, and bewailed it; which I knowing not to be true, Å¿ent to <hi>Anne Davis</hi> to enquire the truth of it, by a relation of hers, who anÅ¿wered, that Å¿he never heard me Å¿peak Å¿uch words, nor any thing like it: So that it is evident, falÅ¿e witneÅ¿Å¿e do not agree; for ye Å¿ay, Å¿ome of you Å¿itting over againÅ¿t me, which muÅ¿t needs be at the Table, upon which, or upon the book, ye Å¿ay, I clapt my hand, when I Å¿pake. But Å¿he Å¿aith, <hi>it was after the meeting was done, and I was gone from the Table,</hi> in which is no agreement. She Å¿aid, <hi>Anne Davis</hi> with her Å¿elfe and another went into the Å¿treets and bewailed it: but <hi>Anne Davis</hi> denies that ever Å¿he heard it. She Å¿aid, <hi>Å¿tanding out in the room, I clapt my hand upon the booke, and Å¿aid, the Scriptures were a plague,</hi> &amp;c. But ye Å¿ay, <hi>I clapt my hand upon the book or table, and Å¿aid, the book or Scriptures were blinde and a plague;</hi> but cannot agree whether it was a Book or a Table, a book or Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: And Å¿o are all in confuÅ¿ion, being led by a lying Å¿pirit, and able by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement to prove nothing. BeÅ¿ides ye Å¿ay, <hi>the book or Scriptures,</hi> but in the copy delivered to me, it was Å¿aid <hi>the Scriptures of truth,</hi> in which is no agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. BeÅ¿ides all this, one of you being asked, if ever he heard me Å¿peak thoÅ¿e words, anÅ¿wered, that hee heard me Å¿peak to this effect, <hi>That the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, as men goe to worke with it, making it a pattern of all manner of vice and wickedneÅ¿Å¿e, was one of the greateÅ¿t plagues,</hi> &amp;c. And being demanded then, why ye had not laid the charge in the very words that were Å¿poken, he was Å¿ilent as to that, and Å¿aid, <hi>he had already purchaÅ¿ed jealouÅ¿ie from Å¿ome in the Church, as one that was in danger,</hi> &amp;c. And this I have under the hand of him to whom it was Å¿poken.</p>
            <p>Now let all, to whom true judgement is known, judge what differing teÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie here is, and how like it appears to that of old, in which no agreement could be againÅ¿t the innocent: And how deÅ¿perately-wicked ye appear under a cloak of Religion, accuÅ¿ing for Å¿omething, but cannot manifeÅ¿t for what, but in it contradict your Å¿elves: And in Å¿ome things <hi>Jane Frye</hi> is nearer the matter than the other 59. or thereabouts who falÅ¿e witneÅ¿Å¿es are found; becauÅ¿e af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a meeting was ended, in which <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> had been Å¿peaking about that Idol called <hi>Divinity,</hi> and the people moÅ¿tly gone, and I roÅ¿e from the Table, and Å¿tanding neer the middle of the room, did there Å¿ay, and declare, <hi>that that accurÅ¿ed thing called the body of Divinity was a plague to the land,</hi> or words to that effect, of which I told you before, though ye wickedly Å¿hut your eyes, and not obÅ¿erved it becauÅ¿e it was the truth. And were it not Å¿o, it had been one with that Å¿pirit to which ye have taken heed.</p>
            <p>But Å¿uppoÅ¿e credit vvere to be given to Å¿uch a generation, vvho in teÅ¿timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny do not agree, but are proved as before, &amp;c. yet to the Reader vvould I Å¿ay, vvhat probability of truth can be in vvhat they Å¿ay I affirmed, <hi>viz. That the Scriptures of truth were one of the greateÅ¿t blindes and plagues to mens Å¿oules this day in England,</hi> as if truth could be a blinde and a plague to Å¿oules, vvhen it is a lying Å¿pirit is Å¿o to yours.

Yet from the Scriptures did I daily diÅ¿courÅ¿e, as opportunity I had; and by it have convinced many amongÅ¿t you, of your pride, formality, and other evils; Å¿o that once ye were very much awakened, and brought to Å¿ome Å¿enÅ¿e of your condition, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ye had been too much taken with the doctrine of Å¿ome called <hi>NotioniÅ¿ts,</hi> which it may be, is the Å¿ame ye now call <hi>Ranters,</hi> whoÅ¿e principles and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, by the Scriptures, I did withÅ¿tand and oppoÅ¿e, and with much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and Å¿ore wreÅ¿tlings was I inÅ¿trumental to deliver you out of their mouths, to whom many of you were become a prey; I Å¿ay, much awakened ye were, and the Å¿pirit which convinceth of Å¿in, began to work, until ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther MiniÅ¿try of unrighteouÅ¿neÅ¿s came, which, for the wages of iniquity, taught you to erre, and (when ye were convinced of Å¿in, and troubled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and Å¿aw your filth and wickedneÅ¿s appear; by which your peace was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and your conÅ¿ciences awakened, and true judgement took hold on the tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿or) preÅ¿t you to believe lyes, and Å¿hut out that which troubled, and Å¿aid it was temptations of the Devil, and that your Å¿in was done away, and that God Å¿aw it not, that it was all pardoned, daubing with untempered mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, crying peace, peace, to that to which no peace is Å¿poken from God, by which your bonds were made Å¿trong, and the hands of evil doers Å¿trengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they turned not, nor repented, which wicked doctrine of the Devil, by the Scripture I oppoÅ¿ed, and withÅ¿tood, perÅ¿wading you to the laÅ¿t, not to build on the Å¿and, but come down to the rock; and told you, your peace was but Å¿ecurity, which the Devils goods may attain, and that all your aÅ¿Å¿urance, in which ye gloried, was but vain confidence, which in the time of tryal would deceive you; and Å¿o far did I diÅ¿pute it with you, dailie, by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that <hi>Thomas Ewins,</hi> your publique Preacher told me, I daÅ¿ht his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and weakened his hands, Å¿o that he was not able to preach, but when into the Pulpit he was to go, fear and trembling Å¿ometimes took hold upon him, Å¿o that if neceÅ¿Å¿ity had not been upon him to Å¿peak, the people being aÅ¿Å¿embled, he Å¿hould not have Å¿poken a word, and told me of retiring to his former Calling, and leaving the City, with much more. Others who loved to have Å¿mooth things Å¿poken, that they might be at eaÅ¿e in <hi>Zion,</hi> who put far away the evil day, complained (as he Å¿aid) that all the comforts and joy they received and gathered from his MiniÅ¿try all the day, was daÅ¿ht and broken by me in the evening. Others complaining, at laÅ¿t confeÅ¿t I led you Å¿afely, though not comfortably; and all was, becauÅ¿e the Devils Kingdom was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿turbed, and his goods not Å¿uffered to be at peace; and in your conÅ¿ciences do you know, that by the Scriptures I demonÅ¿trated what I Å¿aid; to which I was as true as any amongÅ¿t you whatÅ¿oever. And if in this ye Å¿hall Å¿ay I boaÅ¿t, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member its you that have compelled me, and if ye have a mind to gain-Å¿ay or contradict any particular of it, do it honeÅ¿tly, plainly, and down-rightly, not coverty and deceitfullie as ye have done before, that when I come to reply, I may have Å¿omething like as from men, to Å¿peak unto, and not as from a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of fooliÅ¿h toÅ¿t children. For although to this was I was at firÅ¿t averÅ¿e, yet by the power and preÅ¿ence of the living God, Å¿hall I be free and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to quench your thorns, Å¿catter your deceit, and remove your veil, and diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Harlots skirts.</p>

            <p>But friends, Å¿uppoÅ¿e all ye Å¿ay were granted, and that I had indeed, whilÅ¿t I was amongÅ¿t you entertained, and aÅ¿Å¿erted many principles contrary to truth, and Å¿aid, <hi>that the Scriptures of truth were a blinde to Å¿ouls, and one of the greateÅ¿t plagues of the land,</hi> (which I have, and utterly do deny,) And Å¿uppoÅ¿e it were granted an error, and a very great Å¿in Å¿o to Å¿ay and affirm, yet was not all this done in your meeting, whilÅ¿t I was one and amongÅ¿t you? and not then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved nor gain Å¿ayed. And was it not then time for all that feared the Lord, and loved the truth to depart out of Å¿uch an AÅ¿Å¿embly, in which Å¿uch things are permitted to be entertained and publiÅ¿hed without rebuke? Was there any Å¿afety in being one with Å¿uch an Harlot, though Å¿he call her Å¿elf a Church? And are not theÅ¿e things Å¿pots, whilÅ¿t <hi>the true Church of ChriÅ¿t, which is his glorious body, is without Å¿pot or wrinckle?</hi> Surely, little cauÅ¿e have any who know the truth, and love and believe in the light, to be grieved or Å¿ad'ned, that any be drawn from Å¿uch an AÅ¿Å¿embly; and happy for me was the day, in which the light manifeÅ¿ted you, and from amongÅ¿t you Å¿eparated me, to another people, where no Å¿uch principles are entertained, nor permitted to be ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And for mine own part, I do freely declare to all the world, that Å¿ince, by the power of the good Å¿hepherd, I was gathered from amongÅ¿t you, I am fan from entertaining or uttering any Å¿uch things: but do dearly own the Scriptures of truth, as given by inÅ¿piration, and Å¿ee them of great uÅ¿e and Å¿ervice. And if I received and entertained Å¿uch principles, contrary to truth amongÅ¿t you, with you I alÅ¿o left them, to whom the Scripture is of little uÅ¿e, more then to talk of, and trade with for an advantage; and by wreÅ¿ting and corrupting the Å¿ame, make uÅ¿e of it as a veil to cover your deceipt and filthineÅ¿s, but the life thereof do not witneÅ¿s.</p>
            <p>But I have not yet done with your teÅ¿timony, in pag. 13. where ye Å¿ay, <hi>ye inÅ¿ert your admonition verbatim.</hi> Ye charge me with aÅ¿Å¿erting in the Church, doctrines contrary to truth, one of which is, that the Scriptures are not the Word of God, and every tittle of this, ye Å¿ay ye have proved; notwithÅ¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, ye have not proved any thing of it to be true, but only ask if I did not at a meeting at the <hi>Red-lodge</hi> in the Garden-houÅ¿e, before near twenty people Å¿ay Å¿o? one of you being by, &amp;c. Truly the Harlots fore-head is very hard, if at this Å¿he do not bluÅ¿h: What! Lay a general charge, and Å¿ay ye will prove, and have proved every tittle, and yet can Å¿ay nothing, but ask me if it were not Å¿o. And in pag 12. &amp; 13. ye lay <hi>this thing to be aÅ¿Å¿erted in the Church, and Å¿ay ye will prove every tittle,</hi> and now ask me if I did not Å¿peak it at the <hi>Red-lodge</hi> in the Garden-houÅ¿e, which was at a meeting of thoÅ¿e ye call miÅ¿erable delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded people, who are wandring as ye Å¿ay, in the dark. At which time Å¿ay ye; one of us was by. So then, by your own confeÅ¿Å¿ion, either thoÅ¿e ye call mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erable deluded people, who are wandring in the dark, muÅ¿t be the Church, or elÅ¿e ye a company of lyars. And let me tell you, theÅ¿e things are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aequivocations and mental reÅ¿ervations, of which ye Å¿peak, but down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right lying and deceit. And becauÅ¿e I asked where the Scripture called it Å¿elf the Word of God, ye Å¿ay, <hi>for anÅ¿wer, ye Å¿hall give me four plain places in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tead of many;</hi> three of which places have not theÅ¿e expreÅ¿Å¿ions in them, <hi>viz. the Word of God,</hi> much leÅ¿s that the Scriptures calls it Å¿elf Å¿o; and the fourth place Å¿aith, <hi>for laying aÅ¿ide the commandements of God, ye hold the traditions of men, and full well ye reject the commandement of God,</hi> that ye <hi>may keep your own tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions;</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:62941:19"/>and again, <hi>making the Word of God of none effect thorough your traditions.</hi> Now although in this Scripture, the Word of God is mentioned, yet doth the Scripture therefore call it Å¿elf the Word of God? Or rather do not ye manifeÅ¿t your Å¿elves to be <hi>thoÅ¿e that do erre, not knowing the Scriptures nor the Word of God,</hi> which was before the Scripture was written, and from which the Scriptures were given forth, who through your own traditions, and the traditions of other men, do go about <hi>to make the</hi> powerful <hi>Word of God</hi> (by which all things were made, and forever are upheld) <hi>of none effect.</hi> And therefore ye Å¿ay, <hi>what Å¿hall we go to light a candle to the Sun? Have not many judicious and godly Writers proved that the Scriptures are the Word of God?</hi> To which I reply, Many men have both Å¿aid and written it, from whoÅ¿e traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not from the Scriptures, ye have received it; and amongÅ¿t others, thoÅ¿e ye call Popes, PapiÅ¿ts, PrieÅ¿ts and JeÅ¿uits as well as other ignorant and unlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, who wreÅ¿t the Scriptures as ye do, have aÅ¿Å¿erted, and do affirm it, and in their printed books called CatechiÅ¿ms, and ChriÅ¿tian doctrine, have laid it down as principles and fundamentals (as they as well as you call it) to be learned of all good ChriÅ¿tians; in which ye may find alÅ¿o the ground of your word, myÅ¿tical body, Sacraments, and Å¿ome of that ye call inÅ¿titutions, and moÅ¿t, if not all, your invented and carnal obÅ¿ervations uÅ¿ed in and about the worÅ¿hip of your God, for which no ground being in the Scripture, ye and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have by tradition received it from the Popes, Cardinals and PrieÅ¿ts, and other Heathens that know not God. But thoÅ¿e that knew and miniÅ¿tred of the Word of God, which was not <hi>a dead letter,</hi> but quick and powerful, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that men Å¿hould not Å¿ay, <hi>Who Å¿hall aÅ¿cend into heaven to fetch ChriÅ¿t from above, &amp;c. for the word of faith, which they preached, was nigh even in the mouth, and in the heart.</hi> And this is that which againÅ¿t your Å¿elves ye have rejected that ye may hold your own and other mens traditions, received as aforeÅ¿aid, and Å¿o do bear the character of thoÅ¿e wicked men, of which ye Å¿peak, <hi>that caÅ¿t the Word of God behind their backs,</hi> who hate to be reformed thereby.</p>
            <p>And Å¿o having in your blind minds, without the fear of God, rambled tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough what ye had to Å¿ay, in pretence of proof of that ye call your admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which indeed is but Å¿tudied accuÅ¿ations, and from the father of lyes, and invented by his inÅ¿truments amongÅ¿t you, as before I Å¿aid, In the cloÅ¿e ye Å¿ay, <hi>Ye have proved every tittle to be true and clear, Å¿o that ye are no lyars nor falÅ¿e accuÅ¿ers, but muÅ¿t turn that back again upon me, profeÅ¿Å¿ing to all the world I have wronged you in what I have written.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I reply, I wiÅ¿h ye had been found innocent before the Lord, and both true, and clear, and no lyars nor falÅ¿e accuÅ¿ers, then I needed not Å¿o to have Å¿poken; but inÅ¿tead thereof, ye are found more and more guilty, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding iniquity to iniquity; Å¿o that were it needful, I could reckon up many more of the lies, Å¿landers, and falÅ¿e accuÅ¿ations, of which ye Å¿tand guilty: To cloÅ¿e this particular, for I profeÅ¿s to all the world, ye are become Å¿uch a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue, and Cage of falÅ¿e, lying, and deceitful Å¿pirits, that to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, I never met with the like, nor did believe was to be found upon the earth, under the title of a Å¿eparated Congregation, of whom the PariÅ¿h AÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿emblies may Å¿ay (as ye Å¿ay they will) they were better to remain as they are, then come amongÅ¿t you, except they intend to be made, <hi>twofold more the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of hell then they are already;</hi> for inÅ¿tead of proving your Å¿elves no lyars

            <p>In pages, 18, 19. I find a parcel of deceitful Å¿tuff, Å¿carce worth anÅ¿wering, yet can hardlie let paÅ¿s Å¿omething without rebuke; I find you <hi>blaming me for flattering and commending my Å¿elf, as ye Å¿ay, when your Å¿elves have publiÅ¿hed a whole book, moÅ¿tly to vindicate, flatter and commend your Å¿elves, and one anothor in your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil wayes, till your iniquity is found out to be abhorred:</hi> Why had ye not caÅ¿t the beam out of your own eyes, before ye had meddled with motes in mine, and better conÅ¿idered the Scripture ye mention, <hi>viz Let another man praiÅ¿e thee, and not thy own lips.</hi> Again ye Å¿ay, <hi>Amaziah was not blamed for the good he did, but becauÅ¿e he did it not with a perfect heart,</hi> &amp; yet your Å¿elves Å¿peak contemptuouÅ¿ly of perfection, and thoÅ¿e that labour to attain it. Ye Å¿ay, <hi>ye knew my Å¿pirit, and what I did pretend to, and obÅ¿erved my groÅ¿s miÅ¿take, but were not willing to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend me,</hi> &amp;c. which is deceit and hypocriÅ¿ie, for the true Church <hi>cannot bear them that are evil,</hi> but teÅ¿tifies againÅ¿t them. And whereas I had Å¿aid, the knowledge ye had of ChriÅ¿t, Å¿hall profit you nothing, and that your habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was in deceipt, and thorough deceit ye refuÅ¿e to know the Lord, &amp;c. Ye Å¿ay, in this thing <hi>ye did not violently oppoÅ¿e;</hi> and then its like ye confeÅ¿s it, as knowing it was the truth, and why then had ye not repented. Ye Å¿ay, <hi>Å¿ome of you did often tell me, that your comforts Å¿tood not Å¿o much in a knowing, as in an acknowledgement of ChriÅ¿t to be, that which he is Å¿aid to be in the Scriptures, and that ye own no other knowing of ChriÅ¿t, then underÅ¿tandingly to know him in his perÅ¿on without you.</hi> &amp;c. which is the Å¿um of moÅ¿t of the 19. page. And Å¿o have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, and clearly manifeÅ¿ted the ground and foundation of all your Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, comforts, joy and peace, to be one and the Å¿ame with the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Religion of the Pope, JeÅ¿uits, drunkards, Å¿wearers, prophane, ignorant and Å¿uperÅ¿titious people of the world, namely, an acknowledgement of ChriÅ¿t without you, to be that which he is Å¿aid to be in the Scriptures: And Å¿o the devils in this particular excel you, who did not only acknowledge him, but knew him, who he was, <hi>JeÅ¿us the Son of God.</hi> And (concerning the MiniÅ¿ters of ChriÅ¿t, which thoÅ¿e of your literal profeÅ¿Å¿ion, oppoÅ¿ed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ecuted) cryed out, <hi>theÅ¿e are the Å¿ervants of the moÅ¿t high God.</hi> But the comfort, joy and peace of the children of light, Å¿tands not in your ground of general acknowledgement of ChriÅ¿t without them, to be what the Scriptures de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare him to be, but in a particular knowledge of him, as by the Å¿pirit of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineÅ¿s he is revealed within them, whereby they come to witneÅ¿s him the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62941:20"/>Son of God, with power by the reÅ¿urrection from the dead; and Å¿o <hi>Paul</hi> knew him, <hi>and Å¿o to know him, was, and is eternal life,</hi> and witneÅ¿Å¿ed Å¿o to be, by thoÅ¿e to whom he is Å¿o revealed: But this is a myÅ¿terie, hid and unknown to all that lie in the death, and never come to witneÅ¿s the firÅ¿t reÅ¿urrection, but declare the ground of their comforts to Å¿tand in that in which the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the world, with them are one. And this is not to Å¿light and nullifie that glorious perÅ¿on in heaven, as ye falÅ¿elie Å¿ay many of our way do, Å¿coffing and jeering at you, for Å¿peaking of the perÅ¿on of ChriÅ¿t, and thinking to be Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the blood of him that dyed at <hi>JeruÅ¿alem,</hi> which is but your falÅ¿e accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ations and Å¿landers, and proceeds from the Å¿ame fountain and Å¿pirit of envy and wickedneÅ¿s, as <hi>Ralph Farmers</hi> bundles of lies did, in which he and ye are one, and at an agreement for Å¿coffing and jeering, lying, and falÅ¿e accuÅ¿ing, being the works of darkneÅ¿s, in which your generation are exerciÅ¿ed, is deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all that vvalk in the light, vvhich is our vvay, and the vvay everlaÅ¿ting.

            <p>And if thoÅ¿e that owned and Å¿eem to honour the Scripture, in which <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> wrote of ChriÅ¿t, did not believe, but crucified him, when in fleÅ¿h he was made manifeÅ¿t, no marvel then if ye do not believe, who call the verie words of Scripture (in which to you I Å¿pake, page 21. of my former book) Å¿trange and unchriÅ¿tian expreÅ¿Å¿ions, Å¿urelie ye are Å¿trangelie erred from the way of truth, and true wiÅ¿dom, who live in Å¿uch confuÅ¿ion and deceit, one while calling the Scriptures the Word of God, and rule of life, when by wreÅ¿ting it ye can Å¿erve your luÅ¿ts; but when by it ye are reproved for your wickedneÅ¿s, then ye call it <hi>Å¿trange and unchriÅ¿tian expreÅ¿Å¿ions,</hi> and Å¿ay, <hi>The Lord rebuke your railing,</hi> as if the Scripture, which ye term the Word of God and Rule of life, were rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Prophets, and holy men of God, which gave it forth, were railers, becauÅ¿e it bears true teÅ¿timonie againÅ¿t your wicked wayes, as well as others, for the words I mentioned are recorded, <hi>IÅ¿a.</hi> 57. 4. <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 2.1, 2, &amp;c. and in Å¿ome other Scriptures, as the Reader will perceive, that reads my former Book.</p>
            <p>But ye Å¿ay, <hi>its eaÅ¿ie to heap up good words right or wrong:</hi> Alas poor blind peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by what blind guides are ye led? Is it Å¿trange and unchriÅ¿tian expreÅ¿Å¿ions,

            <p>In pag. 21. Ye <hi>Å¿ay, Though Å¿ome of our way have Å¿houted, and cryed HoÅ¿annah, holy, holy, King of IÅ¿rael to</hi> James Nayler, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I reply, When will ye be weary of lying and falÅ¿e accuÅ¿ing, which is the work of the Devill; for none of our way ever Å¿o cried to any man: But that which is our way, is the truth, and the life, and is everlaÅ¿ting, the light and life of men, from which whoÅ¿oever turns aÅ¿ide, forÅ¿akes the right way, and turns to lying vanities, as Å¿ome in this day of the Lords viÅ¿itation have done, who muÅ¿t bear their burthen. But ye are eaÅ¿ily Å¿een of what generation ye are, who watch for an occaÅ¿ion to Å¿peak evill of the way of Truth, and the Saints, and Children of light, who in the fear of the Lord do walk, and in his Councell abide, which to you is not known, who are glad with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by any means to Å¿peak evill of the way of Truth, and the people, who (being gathered into it) are for its Å¿ake become Å¿trangers in the earth, and to their familiar friends, and aliens to their mothers Å¿ons, as all their fathers were. But in this again are ye and <hi>Ralph Farmer</hi> one; and by one and the Å¿ame Å¿pirit are ye guided, to whom it is known, that thoÅ¿e that cried as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿aid, are not of our way, but denied and witneÅ¿Å¿ed againÅ¿t before ever they did thoÅ¿e actions. But if I Å¿hould go about to gather up the actions and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿Å¿ions, contrary to truth, which I have known and heard paÅ¿Å¿e from Å¿ome of your vvay (which is a very broad way) how abominable filthy would it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. But I forbear, farther then it may be for your advantage. Yet let me aske, if none of your way which is the broad vvay, leading to deÅ¿truction, did tell me it vvas the pride of <hi>Mordecais</hi> heart, that bovved not to <hi>Haman:</hi> And another, that the Rulers and Elders had Å¿inned, if they had not crucified, or put ChriÅ¿t to death, becauÅ¿e they judged him a blaÅ¿phemer. And another, that the Pope and JeÅ¿uits do believe in ChriÅ¿t. But this I caÅ¿t not upon you, vvhom I knovv not particularly guilty; but that ye may Å¿ee the unjuÅ¿tneÅ¿Å¿e of your ovvn ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuÅ¿ations, and that the guilty ones may Å¿ee it and be aÅ¿hamed.</p>
            <p>Ye fall a vvondring at my Å¿hameleÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, as ye call it, in mentioning, <hi>that Å¿ome of you did beate in your meetings, like the enemies of ChriÅ¿t in the Å¿ynagogues,</hi> And Å¿ay, <hi>yee will declare to all the world the truth of this Å¿tory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To vvhich I Å¿ay, if ye can at laÅ¿t declare truth, it's vvell, and fit ye had done it Å¿ooner: But ye tell hovv Sathan hath raged at your vvomens praying, in vvhich its like ye miÅ¿take, and that it vvas the vvitneÅ¿Å¿e of God that Å¿trives againÅ¿t your hypocriÅ¿ie, as it did of old againÅ¿t your fathers, vvhen their vvaies vvere corrupt before the Lord: And vvoe unto you, vvhen it Å¿hall Å¿trive no more.</p>
            <p>Ye Å¿ay, <hi>Two wretched women came ruÅ¿hing into the roome, one of which had been an old Ranter, the other a late member of this Church.</hi> Whereas they had been one as much a member vvith you, as the other, and neither are Ranters, but in Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berneÅ¿Å¿e do vvalk, and Å¿o came into your meeting; and, as ye Å¿ay, told you, <hi>the prayers of the wicked is an abhomination to the Lord:</hi> With vvhich you vvere diÅ¿turbed, and the Woman forced to give over.</p>

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62941:21"/>the very words of the Scripture are your diÅ¿turbance. And therefore, like the <hi>Gadarens</hi> who in this are your pattern, ye deÅ¿ired as ye Å¿ay, theÅ¿e diÅ¿turb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to depart your room (as they did ChriÅ¿t to depart their CoaÅ¿ts:) But when they departed not, ye exceeded your pattern, as ye your Å¿elves confeÅ¿s, and would have put them out (its like) by force, which ye Å¿ay is all the beating and occaÅ¿ion of it: Which is an abÅ¿olute lie, for down the Å¿tairs yee would have thrown them, as your fathers would have thrown ChriÅ¿t down the brow of the hill, which to do ye did attempt, haling, beating, and pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them till their bodies were Å¿ore, in which your marks they did bear a long time after. So that here appears no truth nor ancient godlineÅ¿Å¿e, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in them that did it, and this wickedneÅ¿Å¿e do I not juÅ¿tifie, being condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the light, to which it is abhomination, and a more wicked thing than for two Å¿ober women to come Å¿oberly into your meeting, and declare amongÅ¿t you the truth; whether ye hear or forbear.</p>
            <p>In page 23. ye endeavour the beÅ¿t you can to veile your Å¿elves from the Å¿troak of truth, contained in <hi>PÅ¿alm</hi> 83. and in the PropheÅ¿ie of <hi>Obadiah.</hi> But all in vain, for it is your portion, and ye muÅ¿t bear it; from him who with righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e doth judge the poor; and your demanding what groÅ¿Å¿e darkneÅ¿s is upon my minde, that I Å¿hould be crying out againÅ¿t you that are innocent, will not veile you. Nay, notwithÅ¿tanding ye demand again, whether I be not joyned with all the PapiÅ¿ts, AtheiÅ¿ts, Ranters, and all the ungodly rabble of the world, in this one great deÅ¿igne of the Devil, to break in pieces the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of ChriÅ¿t, &amp;c.

            <p>To which I anÅ¿wer, nay, with the Harlot I am not joyned, for then muÅ¿t I be one body with you. But from among you all am I Å¿eparated by the power of the Lord, to witneÅ¿Å¿e his preÅ¿ence, And therefore your Å¿elves, with all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piÅ¿ts, AtheiÅ¿ts, Ranters, and ungodly rabble of the world, who in the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿igne of the Devill are joyned, to hate the light, and perÅ¿ecute and oppoÅ¿e the life &amp; power of God, do I deny, and Å¿tand a witneÅ¿Å¿e againÅ¿t. And although ye are the many-headed BeaÅ¿t in divers forms, Å¿ects and opinions, under the name of PapiÅ¿ts, AtheiÅ¿ts, Independents, AnabaptiÅ¿ts, &amp;c. and upon a like ground pretend to ChriÅ¿ts perÅ¿on, GoÅ¿pel, and Ordinances, as before I Å¿aid, and with one mouth, and with one Å¿houlder, cry out againÅ¿t, and oppoÅ¿e his light and living preÅ¿ence, for which ye aÅ¿Å¿ociate and take counÅ¿ell together of one and the Å¿ame lying Å¿pirit, yet ye muÅ¿t be broken, and as a new threÅ¿hing inÅ¿trument is the Lord making the worm <hi>Jacob,</hi> to threÅ¿h your mountains, as chaffe, and your little hills as duÅ¿t: And the day of your diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿e and viÅ¿ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is begun, in which all that Å¿ee you Å¿hall wag the head, who with the moÅ¿t embittered enemies are joyned againÅ¿t the light and life of God, and with AtheiÅ¿ts, Drunkards, and prophane perÅ¿ons, who live in Å¿coffing, Å¿corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reproaching, and deriding, in Å¿landering, falÅ¿hood and lies, do ye aÅ¿Å¿em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, teaching the wicked of the world your wayes, and the Children that have not underÅ¿tanding, to blaÅ¿pheme the light, and living way to the Father, which is your own returned.</p>
            <p>But can ye be honeÅ¿t and own what ye Å¿ay, and novv flie from it? If Å¿o, then I demand, Is it indeed the great deÅ¿igne of the Devil, to break in pieces the Congregations in <hi>England,</hi> under the names of <hi>Independents, AnabaptiÅ¿ts, Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:62941:22"/>&amp;c. as ye pretend it is? If nay, then are ye falÅ¿e and deceitfull in what ye have written: If yea, then is there a falÅ¿e Prophet, and MiniÅ¿ter of Satan to be found amongÅ¿t you, in whoÅ¿e mouth he hath been a lying Å¿pirit, to which ye ought to give no longer heed. For <hi>Robert Purnell,</hi> in his book entitled, <hi>Good newes to Å¿inners, great joy to Saints,</hi> declares the contrary. And in pag. 65. undertakes to be a Prophet, and Å¿aith, <hi>a few words by way of propheÅ¿ie of the downfall of Presbytery, Independency, AnabaptiÅ¿me, &amp;c.</hi> And then he calls upon all the Å¿ervants of the moÅ¿t high and mighty God, heirs of promiÅ¿e, and Å¿ons of Zion to look for great alterations and changes, and to Å¿ee what deÅ¿olations God will make in the earth, and for nothing but the Lord to be revealed from heaven, which Å¿aith he will be mighty in his diÅ¿penÅ¿ations, exceeding glorious in his revelation, and Å¿trong and powerfull in his operation, and will bring to paÅ¿Å¿e his determinations, and deÅ¿troy in this mountain the face of the cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caÅ¿t over all people, and the veile that is Å¿pread over all Nations; which veile he Å¿aith, is knowing ChriÅ¿t and ChriÅ¿tians after the fleÅ¿h, which <hi>Paul</hi> did not do, after his eyes were opened, &amp;c. And Å¿o he goes on to manifeÅ¿t how <hi>Presbyterians, Independents, AnabaptiÅ¿ts,</hi> &amp;c. are all vailed with the Å¿ame veile, And therefore Å¿aith he, what I Å¿ay to one Sect, I Å¿ay to all, ye Å¿hall Å¿peedily receive a totall rout. <hi>Yee have gathered your Å¿elve together, but ye Å¿hall be Å¿catter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yea yee Å¿hall be broken in pieces.</hi> Ye all have built your outward houÅ¿e of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall diÅ¿cipline upon the Å¿and, and it muÅ¿t fall, becauÅ¿e it is not grounded upon the Rock ChriÅ¿t. Ye have made your communion the ground of your union, and that muÅ¿t fall, becauÅ¿e it is not the Lords, but mans building: And himÅ¿elfe puts the queÅ¿tion how he knew <hi>Presbytery, Independency, AnabaptiÅ¿me,</hi> and the reÅ¿t of the Sects muÅ¿t down, and anÅ¿wers, if <hi>Abraham</hi> by faith did Å¿ee the day of ChriÅ¿t coming in the fleÅ¿h many years before he came, why may not I (Å¿aith he) and others Å¿ee the day of ChriÅ¿t coming in the Å¿pirit (to deÅ¿troy all fleÅ¿hly forms) Å¿ome few years before it be finiÅ¿hed: And again Å¿aith he, I have by faith Å¿een all theÅ¿e opinions fall, and have heard from many others, that they have Å¿een them fall alÅ¿o. Therefore that which I have heard and Å¿een declare I unto you, <hi>that ye might have fellowÅ¿hip with the father and the Å¿on in the Å¿pirit;</hi> for then, Å¿aith he, and not till then ye will give over Å¿aying, as in effect ye do, <hi>I am of Paul, I am of Apollo.</hi> Then ye will not Å¿o much cry up the forme, but endeavour the power of godlineÅ¿Å¿e. TheÅ¿e with many more, are his words, as the Reader may Å¿ee in his foreÅ¿aid book.</p>
            <p>Now therefore, if it be true, that all theÅ¿e formes are fleÅ¿hly, and are not built upon the Rock ChriÅ¿t, but upon the Å¿and, are not the Lords, but mens building, and therefore muÅ¿t fall, and be broken to pieces, and Å¿cattered, and Å¿peedily receive a totall rout. And that he by faith hath Å¿een it all fall; and hath both heard and Å¿een what he declared, that is to Å¿ay, ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Å¿pirit to deÅ¿troy them, that people might have fellowÅ¿hip with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son in the Spirit. Then are <hi>Robert Purnell</hi> and you found dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly in the Å¿teps and practice of your Fathers, the Scribes and PhariÅ¿ees, who (when ChriÅ¿t came in the fleÅ¿h, according to the Prophecies that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) Å¿aid, <hi>It was the Devil a blaÅ¿phemer, a friend to publicans and Å¿inners,</hi> &amp;c. For ye, now that ChriÅ¿t in Å¿pirit, in life and power, is appeared, mighty in diÅ¿pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ations, glorious in revelation, and very Å¿trong and powerfull in operation, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king great alterations, changes and deÅ¿olations in the earth, and revealing

Now have ye not read that <hi>God is not mocked? but what ye Å¿owe, the Å¿ame yee muÅ¿t reape.</hi> Why then doe yee thus <hi>to the fleÅ¿h Å¿owe corruption,</hi> falÅ¿hood, lying and deceit, and make mention of <hi>the name of the Lord</hi> as your covering?</p>
            <p>To what they Å¿aid to me in particular, I need not Å¿ay much, becauÅ¿e what I Å¿aid before Å¿tands unanÅ¿wered, and in power over your heads, only they Å¿ay, the things they charged me withal are true, every Å¿yllable, as appears by the foregoing anÅ¿wer of the whole Church, which is falÅ¿e, and thoÅ¿e they call the Church proved lyars: And whereas they Å¿ay, they did not feare me, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did their conÅ¿ciences accuÅ¿e them. In this they preÅ¿ently gave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves the lie, and Å¿ay the reaÅ¿on they Å¿taid not was, becauÅ¿e they found my Å¿pirit the time before as a boyling fornace boyling over, and Å¿calding all that Å¿tand near it, which made them reÅ¿olve not to Å¿tay the Å¿econd time. Now what deceit and wickedneÅ¿Å¿e is here? Who can believe a word that comes from amongÅ¿t you, who are out of the feare of God, and therefore regard not what ye Å¿ay. For I having charged them in my laÅ¿t, that they fled as men Å¿urprized with feare, or accuÅ¿ed by their own conÅ¿ciences: They deny it, and Å¿ay it is falÅ¿e, and that they neither feared me, nor were accuÅ¿ed, &amp;c. And yet in 6. or 8, lines have fully granted what I Å¿aid, Å¿aying the reaÅ¿on they Å¿taid not, was becauÅ¿e they found my Å¿prrit as a boyling fornace, boyling over and Å¿calding, &amp;c. Now is it not evident, they feared leÅ¿t they Å¿hould be Å¿calded? and what was there that Å¿calded, but the witneÅ¿Å¿e of God within themÅ¿elves? Poor men! I knew they were wounded, tormented, and Å¿calded by the witneÅ¿s of God, in their own conÅ¿ciences, teÅ¿tifying againÅ¿t their hypocriÅ¿ie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, Å¿o that they could not Å¿tand, nor abide it; for the day of the Lord is now great, and who may abide it; for it is like refiners fire, <hi>yea it burns as an oven, and all that doe wickedly are as Å¿tubble,</hi> and not onely Å¿calded, but burned muÅ¿t ye be, and neither root nor branch Å¿hall be left. And the falÅ¿e Prophets that Å¿ee vanity, and divine lies, and all that imbrace and receive them, who muÅ¿t not be in the aÅ¿Å¿embles of Gods people, are not in a capacity (as they Å¿ay) for thoÅ¿e that feare the name of the Lord, to converÅ¿e withall. Neither is dried Å¿tubble in a capacity to contend with thoÅ¿e in whom the Å¿pirit of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and burning is, left thereby they be both Å¿calded and burned.</p>

And therefore to you, or to one of you I Å¿ay, do not eate and drinke with the drunken, do not fill your Å¿elves with wine and ftrong drink, nor Å¿pend the creation of God upon your luÅ¿ts: Do not Å¿pend your time out of the feare of the Lord, in pleaÅ¿ure and wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, in lightneÅ¿Å¿e and vanity, abuÅ¿ing the Å¿ervants of the Lord, <hi>For he is at the door, and ye know him not, that will cut you aÅ¿under</hi> (except ye repent) and all your inventions, traditions, fooliÅ¿h cuÅ¿tomes, and carnall waÅ¿hings, will not hide nor help you: And this is a warning to thoÅ¿e of you <hi>that forget God, and caÅ¿t his law,</hi> which is light, <hi>behinde your backs,</hi> to conÅ¿ider, <hi>leÅ¿t he teare you in pieces, and there be none to deliver you,</hi> who as unÅ¿avourie Å¿alt are become, whoÅ¿e ill Å¿avour is gone abroad from AlehouÅ¿es and Taverns (too much frequented) Å¿porting your Å¿elves with the enemies of God, with which ye now begin to appear as one, rather than to be grieved for the afflictions of <hi>JoÅ¿eph,</hi> or to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come companions of thoÅ¿e, who for witneÅ¿Å¿ing the power and life of JeÅ¿us, do Å¿uffer by the world, the generation of Vipers, as ever they did of old. And this is all the fruit I know that your invented waÅ¿hings have brought you to, and yet for this time I do very much Å¿pare one of you.</p>
            <p>But why are <hi>Robert SimpÅ¿on</hi> and <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> Å¿o much troubled, that my letters to each of them are made publique; for what is publiÅ¿hed was written to them many moneths before, without an intent to publiÅ¿h it, and in all that time, which one of them acknowledgeth, was above a yeare, no anÅ¿wer was given in word or writing, nor any word Å¿poken to me about it by them, teÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying diÅ¿like, as if all were quiet and well. But now it's made publique, and brought to light, and their deeds Å¿een and openly reproved, how angry do they appear, crying out of wrong, lies, &amp;c. and after me pour their floods of contempt, reproach and Å¿corn, notwithÅ¿tanding, under their hands it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, I was before called their honoured Brother, and when of worldly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours I could accept (though I did not, as others Å¿eek it) and when into his mouth I could freely put, <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> to me cryed peace, and in my abÅ¿ence declared he had little or no encouragement to abide in <hi>BriÅ¿tol,</hi> were it not for me But Å¿ince to the light I have been turned, and by it convinced of the blindneÅ¿s and falÅ¿eneÅ¿s of your minds and worÅ¿hips, and could not <hi>put into his mouth,</hi> as before, hovv doth he <hi>bite with the teeth, and prepare war againÅ¿t me,</hi> though his weapons appear too weak and carnall to prevail, againÅ¿t which the bowe is in Å¿trength; and the Reader, whoÅ¿e eyes are opened, will eaÅ¿ily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that had not the things been true, which to each of them I writ, and not at all to be gainÅ¿aid, nor contradicted, they would in all that time, either in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62941:25"/>words or writing, plead their own innocency againÅ¿t me, who had Å¿o much wronged them as now they pretend: But being very true, and not to be gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿aid, the Å¿ubtileÅ¿t beaÅ¿t in the field (it's like) perÅ¿wades them to be quiet, that it be not noiÅ¿ed abroad, but in oblivion kept: But Å¿ince, beyond their expectation it is come to light, and they cannot prevent it; Å¿ome courÅ¿e (if it be poÅ¿Å¿ible) muÅ¿t be taken, that it be not believed. And therefore (how falÅ¿ly Å¿oever accuÅ¿ed) it muÅ¿t be of lyes, falÅ¿hood, and folly, though themÅ¿elves feel the power of it, Å¿tanding in truth and wiÅ¿dome, and have not told the Reader in what the folly and falÅ¿hood lies: But (by all the means they are able) labour to recover a veil, though but little have either they or you done, more then to enÅ¿nare your Å¿elves in your own vvorks, whoÅ¿e webb is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a garment, neither do your works profit, for your works are works of vanity: But how comes it to paÅ¿Å¿e, that my letters were true, and not to be contradicted before they vvere publiÅ¿hed, but are not Å¿o novv? Why onely thus, our skirts are diÅ¿covered, our Å¿epulchre is opened, and our nakedneÅ¿Å¿e is novv made manifeÅ¿t, that people (as vve paÅ¿Å¿e the Å¿treet) point us out <hi>Noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,</hi> and at us vvag the head; Å¿o that before the people (that are not vvilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blinde) vve and our povverleÅ¿s, hypocritical profeÅ¿Å¿ion (vvhich Å¿tands in vvords and forms, not in Å¿pirit and povver) are like to receive but little ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
            <p>Novv becauÅ¿e they have vvritten Å¿everally, I Å¿hall reply particularly: And firÅ¿t to <hi>Robert SimpÅ¿on,</hi> in vvhom (me thinks) I Å¿ee moÅ¿t honeÅ¿ty, though it be clouded and covered vvith much deceit and hypocriÅ¿ie, vvhich the light reproves: And had I not a deÅ¿ire very much to Å¿pare him, for the honeÅ¿ties Å¿ake, the Å¿econd Å¿troak vvould exceed the firÅ¿t: And becauÅ¿e I perceive his main vvork (as vvell as yours) is to Å¿eek a veile of deceipt, under vvhich to hide himÅ¿elfe from the Å¿troke of truth, and to attain it, Å¿pends himÅ¿elfe in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny light, vaine, and angry words, which have little weight, I Å¿hall not trouble my Å¿elfe, nor the Reader in Å¿peaking much to it, for of it Å¿elfe it falls, yet I would not that he Å¿hould Å¿o often take the name of the Lord in vaine, as he doth in the beginning of what he Å¿peaks, <hi>for the Lord will not hold him guiltleÅ¿s.</hi> But in page 29. he Å¿aith, <hi>If the charge I laid upon him were Å¿o indeed, how Å¿ad were his condition? Well might his countenance be changed, and his thoughts trouble him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I reply, That though he hath laboured till (he Å¿aith) he hath forgotten himÅ¿elfe, to vindicate or cover himÅ¿elf from what was truly laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, yet from it hath he not delivered himÅ¿elfe, but the charge Å¿tands good, in Å¿ound and Å¿ober words, in the power of truth, and <hi>whiles he covereth his Å¿in be cannot proÅ¿per.</hi> And whiles he addeth one iniquity to another, he cannot come into Gods righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e: And oh! that he would conÅ¿ider it, and lay it to heart whiles he hath time, that in the day of the Lords anger, which is at hand, and as a deÅ¿truction from the Almighty Å¿hall come, he might be hid and find mercy of the Lord, with whom his vain Å¿peaking of a witneÅ¿Å¿e he hath in heaven brought from thence into his heart, and confirmed by the Spirit of Truth, and of his being taken up into the Mount to confer with him, who hath all power given him and of a Warrant Å¿ealed and given forth <hi>from him that hath al power,</hi> &amp;c. is of little accompt, whiles he underÅ¿tands not what he Å¿peaks; <hi>For the Kingdom of God cometh not with obÅ¿ervation, but the kingdome of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62941:26"/>God is within,</hi> and in his Kingdom he is who dwells in heaven, where the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Word and Spirit agree, of which all blind PhariÅ¿aical ProfeÅ¿Å¿ors are ignorant and cannot know it, till in the light, and by the Å¿pirit it be revealed and made manifeÅ¿t.</p>
            <p>And whereas he Å¿aith, <hi>All that he, with the reÅ¿t, laid at my door, was to a tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle true; and that neither he nor his brethren have any reluctance for it.</hi> This is all falÅ¿, for I have before proved it lies and deceit, and themÅ¿elves have confeÅ¿t they found that which boiled like a furnace, and Å¿calded all that Å¿tand near it, and they were near it, and Å¿o reÅ¿olved not to Å¿tay another time. And judgement is now laid to the line, and righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s to the plummet, and all refuges of lies and deceit are to be Å¿wept away, and by truth and Å¿oberneÅ¿s Å¿uch hiding places are overflown, and in Å¿oberneÅ¿s do I Å¿tand; and Å¿o much to my Å¿elf am I come, that I Å¿ee many of his words there mentioned to veil and cover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf, to be light and vain, and not worth anÅ¿wering, and that what I writ, was both Å¿ober and true, without fawning and flattery, in which many among you are too much exerciÅ¿ed, who love to have Å¿mooth, not true things Å¿poken, and would have me peaceable, gentle, and full of mercy to hypocriÅ¿ie, deceit and wickedneÅ¿s, all which is for judgement, and no peace from God is Å¿poken to it. And therefore without partiality do I declare againÅ¿t it in him and you, as well as in others, and to my Å¿elf am I not a Å¿tranger. And this is pure wiÅ¿dom from above, and moderation, known unto all that receive and believe in the light, by which that Å¿pirit appearing in my former book, is juÅ¿tified, though to you that hate the light, and by the light are condemned it is as gall and worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word. And for Å¿porting my Å¿elf, and inÅ¿ulting over him; I did it not, but it is another refuge of lies; for I told him before, I did not inÅ¿ult over him, nor delight in his wo and miÅ¿ery, but was Å¿orely grieved, as Å¿till I am, to Å¿ee how the wicked one, whom the Lord would deÅ¿troy, was exalted in him and you, and what I writ is true. And whereas he Å¿aith, I was not a in a Å¿ober mind, but at a diÅ¿tance from it, and true Å¿peaking (when I mentioned to him the portion of lyars) and that not any thing he Å¿aid was a lie, but what he Å¿aid I had not his hand to, as his particular affirmation; and Å¿o goes on Å¿peaking many words, but to what purpoÅ¿e I cannot Å¿ee, except it be by words to darken the Readers underÅ¿tanding. But if I miÅ¿take not, that which he would do, is to vindicate himÅ¿elf from being a lyar, with what elÅ¿e I charged upon him in my former Letter, by telling me he Å¿aid I had not his hand to it, as his particular accuÅ¿ation. And if this be his meaning, then is it groÅ¿s deceit, for I never Å¿aid or thought it was his particular accuÅ¿ation, but a general accuÅ¿ation deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by him, in which himÅ¿elf and each other particular, was included, and Å¿o I Å¿pake to him in Å¿oberneÅ¿s and pitty, my very howels moving towards him, knowing my Å¿elf innocent, and that it was a dreadful thing for him in the Name or the Lord to Å¿peak a falÅ¿e viÅ¿ion or thing. I asked him, how he durÅ¿t come to me, and in the name of the Lord tell me, I Å¿aid the Scriptures of truth were one of the greateÅ¿t plagues of the land, when I never Å¿pake nor thought Å¿uch a thing. To which he replyed, <hi>he never Å¿pake it, nor laid it to my charge,</hi> though out of his own mouth it came; and when I told him I had it under his hand, he denyed it. When I told him I could Å¿hew it him, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>if I could, he would acknowledge himÅ¿elf a lyar;</hi> upon which ground I char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him for it as before, and Å¿o I do Å¿till, and good were it for him, if he own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62941:26"/>the judgement and repented, for otherwiÅ¿e he cannot eÅ¿cape. But if he forgeting that his hand was to his paper, did run himÅ¿elf into the evil of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying it, as is before expreÅ¿t; yet if (when he came to the Å¿ight of his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror) he had clearly acknowledged it, and owned his condemnation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented, to which in love he was adviÅ¿ed, there had been mercy for him: but being convinced and reproved of the evil, hardened his neck, and labours to hide and cover his Å¿in, adding one iniquity unto another; here he cannot proÅ¿per, but brings himÅ¿elf juÅ¿tly under, not onely the judgement and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation mentioned in my former Letter, but more and more miÅ¿ery due to thoÅ¿e that rebel againÅ¿t the light, by which they are reproved, and to thoÅ¿e that add iniquity unto iniquity, and muÅ¿t not come into Gods righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s. And from it all the waters in <hi>Jordan</hi> can never waÅ¿h him, not the Rocks and Mountains cover him, nor all your outward obÅ¿ervations, imaginations and will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worÅ¿hips, preÅ¿erve him, till he own the light, by which he is convinced and reproved, and the juÅ¿t condemnation thereof paÅ¿s upon the rebellious, and the tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿or which hath Å¿inned, and he brought to repentance, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the truth; and Å¿o his Å¿oul come to be Å¿aved in this migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty day of the Lords power. And this is not from a violent heat of wild-fire, as he calls it, but from a Å¿pirit of Å¿oberneÅ¿s, Å¿oundneÅ¿s and truth, and is true love to his Å¿oul; and the time is near, in which he that rebuketh plainly Å¿hall find more favour then he that flattereth with his lips, and my end is not to make him a tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿or before all, as he Å¿uppoÅ¿eth, but according to my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure to adviÅ¿e him, into the way, the light, the life and the truth, which lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth out of tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ion, into the inheritance of the Saints in light; and in this I do not equivocate, nor evade, as he falÅ¿ely chargeth me, but do Å¿peak plainly and truly, though at it, both he and ye are offended. And both Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ¿m and the Lords Supper I do own, as before I Å¿aid; and all your traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, imaginations, inventions carnal obÅ¿ervations and will-worÅ¿hips I do deny, who in the many things (about which ye are troubled) oftend all, and are not come to the one BaptiÅ¿m, by which the Saints were baptized into one body; nor know not the Cup of the New TeÅ¿tament, nor the bread of life, which is the life of men, nor the fruit of the Vine, of which ChriÅ¿t with his DiÅ¿ciples drank new in his Fathers Kingdom; and Å¿o are feeding your Å¿elves with that which will never Å¿atisfie, but is corruptible, and muÅ¿t periÅ¿h in the uÅ¿ing. And the ground on which ye Å¿tand and queÅ¿tion me is not good, but of God is rejected, and bryars and thorns doth it bring forth, and its near unto curÅ¿ing. And whereas he Å¿aith, though he was not preÅ¿ent when I Å¿pake Å¿o reproachfully of the Scriptures, yet he did believe it, and Å¿till doth.</p>
            <p>I <hi>Reply,</hi> Here is plainly, and without equivocation, as he calls it, the ground of your lies and Å¿landers, falÅ¿e accuÅ¿ations and charges, as well as of your windy, heady, and powerleÅ¿s Religion, (that is to Å¿ay) your believing things, which ye neither heard nor Å¿aw, but have got by tradition and hearÅ¿ay from others, as he confeÅ¿Å¿eth of himÅ¿elf in this particular, and few can believe it beÅ¿ides thoÅ¿e that are given over to believe lyes, becauÅ¿e there is no truth at all in it. And although he Å¿aith, I had not his hand in particular, to what he heard not, yet I know I had it to the whole, of which that is a part; and I have it to that which he denies, and Å¿aith, I had it not; and well was it that I had it under hand, or elÅ¿e how Å¿tiffely would it be denyed and gainÅ¿ayed, as it
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62941:27"/>was directly at firÅ¿t, and after plain conviction, what Å¿huffling and deceit is here uÅ¿ed amongÅ¿t you, to hide and cover it, though to little purpoÅ¿e? And had I not by the wiÅ¿dom of God, had a Coppy of your charge, Å¿igned by Å¿ome of your Å¿elves, how muÅ¿t all your lyes and forged accuÅ¿ations (which ye pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liÅ¿h and Å¿ay was <hi>verbatim,</hi> and proved to a tittle and Å¿yllable) paÅ¿s for truth, becauÅ¿e ye Å¿ay it is Å¿o, which by the Å¿aid Coppy is proved not <hi>verbatim,</hi> nor is proved true, but the contrary.</p>
            <p>And whereas <hi>Robert SimpÅ¿on</hi> declares <hi>I had no ground at all, to lay that agrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of lying upon him,</hi> viz. a lye invented, a lye proÅ¿ecuted, a lye denyed, and the lye proved, and afterwards adviÅ¿eth me not to evade nor equivocate, but Å¿peak truly, and deal plainly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> I have before dealt Å¿o truly and plainly, without flattery, that ye are offended, yet I Å¿hall take his adviÅ¿e, and plainly declare, the lye was inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted amongÅ¿t you, when ye Å¿tudied your accuÅ¿ations, the lye was proÅ¿ecuted by your MeÅ¿Å¿engers, who charged me with the guilt of what ye had falÅ¿ely contrived. The lye was denyed by <hi>Robert SimpÅ¿on,</hi> when he denied that he Å¿pake Å¿uch a thing, or laid it to my charge, though I had it under his hand; and the lye by me Å¿tands proved, both on you and him, from which ye can never deliver your Å¿elves by all your Å¿hifting and Å¿triving, but like a bird in the Å¿nare, the more ye Å¿trive, the more ye are intangled, till ye acknowledge your iniquitie, and own your condemnation, and repent. And Å¿o <hi>Robert SimpÅ¿ons</hi> weapons being but the wrath and deceivableneÅ¿s of man, and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der promiÅ¿e of a bleÅ¿Å¿ing from God, are found too carnal (as he acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) to war againÅ¿t the Lamb and his followers, whoÅ¿e weapons are not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal like his, but mighty, thorough God, to the pulling down, and laying low all high things, Å¿o that no lying refuges, nor deceitful coverings, are able to Å¿tand. But the Armies of the world, who follow the beaÅ¿t, to make war with the Lamb, do flie and fall before them. <hi>Glory to him that Å¿its upon the throne, and to the Lamb for evermore.</hi>

               <p>I Find <hi>Thomas Ewins,</hi> in the beginning of his word, as he calls it, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the receipt of my Letter above a year Å¿ince, never intending to anÅ¿wer it; but Å¿ince it is publiÅ¿hed, takes himÅ¿elf bound to anÅ¿wer, and makes uÅ¿e of <hi>Solomons</hi> words, to cover his deceitful pretences, juÅ¿t like one whom God abhors, which teacheth for hire, and devineth for money, and corrupteth the Scriptures, with which he trades; for doth he not know that the true reaÅ¿on of his intending never to anÅ¿wer, was (not leÅ¿t he Å¿hould be like unto me, as he pretends, but rather) knowing the guilt, dreaded the conteÅ¿t, and would gladly bury it in Å¿ilence; but being made publique, holds himÅ¿elf bound to anÅ¿wer, not leÅ¿t I be wiÅ¿e, &amp;c. but leÅ¿t (his wickedneÅ¿s and deceit being made manifeÅ¿t, and he proved out of the wayes, and out of the life of the MiniÅ¿ters of ChriÅ¿t, and in the wayes and Å¿teps of thoÅ¿e MaÅ¿ters, whoÅ¿e gain came in by devination) he in this might Å¿uffer loÅ¿s, and accompt himÅ¿elf bound to prevent it; and by Å¿orcery and wicked art, makes uÅ¿e of <hi>Solomons</hi> words as his covering.</p>
               <p>Now becauÅ¿e his word is Å¿o large, and Å¿o little of worth or wiÅ¿dom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62941:27"/>therein, being a parcel of dead and dull Å¿tuff. And becauÅ¿e his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, lightneÅ¿s and confuÅ¿ion, is Å¿o plainly to be read in his own lines, by all that walk in the fear and counÅ¿el of the Lord, I Å¿hall not trouble my Å¿elf, nor the Reader, with anÅ¿wering every particular, as it lies, but rather out of his heap of confuÅ¿ion, take up a little, letting the reÅ¿t remain.</p>
               <p>In the firÅ¿t place, he finds fault with me, for publiÅ¿hing his acknowledging himÅ¿elf no MiniÅ¿ter of the GoÅ¿pel, and declares the grounds on which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied himÅ¿elf a MiniÅ¿ter, but not a Preacher of the GoÅ¿pel, but hath miÅ¿t to inÅ¿ert the true ground upon which I Å¿o declared him; which was, that in Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious diÅ¿pute or diÅ¿courÅ¿e he hath not been able by the Scriptures to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain himÅ¿elf a MiniÅ¿ter of the GoÅ¿pel, but made to acknowledge the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and that before Å¿everal witneÅ¿Å¿es But how is it, that he denied himÅ¿elf, as he Å¿aith, to be a MiniÅ¿ter, but not a Preacher of the GoÅ¿pel? Did any ever preach the GoÅ¿pel, who had not the treaÅ¿ure of it in their earthen veÅ¿Å¿els? Or did ever any who had the treaÅ¿ure within them, preach and not miniÅ¿ter of the Å¿ame, as good Å¿tewards of the grace of God? Truly, he that is Å¿uch a man (notwithÅ¿tanding he may vainly boaÅ¿t of his abilities, and approbation, and being Å¿ent forth by men) had need to Å¿eek a better proof of his MiniÅ¿try, or elÅ¿e muÅ¿t never be owned by ChriÅ¿t, as one of his.</p>
               <p>He Å¿aith, he denyed himÅ¿elf a MiniÅ¿ter of any PariÅ¿h in <hi>BriÅ¿tol,</hi> a MiniÅ¿ter in Office, not having been called, conÅ¿tituted, or ordained, &amp;c And that he hath put off that honour and dignity, from a Å¿enÅ¿e of the weight and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of that high calling, and of the great unworthineÅ¿s and unfitneÅ¿s he Å¿aw in himÅ¿elf of Å¿o glorious an employment; but Å¿aith, that he hath been and is (though the unworthieÅ¿t upon earth) a Preacher and a publiÅ¿her of the glorious GoÅ¿pel of the grace of God, both in <hi>Wales,</hi> and now in <hi>BriÅ¿tol,</hi> he hath no need to Å¿eek a proof of me or any other man.</p>
               <p>To which I Å¿ay, his own proof is too light and empty, to prove him a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of the GoÅ¿pel; and in it Å¿elf Å¿ufficiently diÅ¿covers him no MiniÅ¿ter of ChriÅ¿t, but in confuÅ¿ion; for the MiniÅ¿ters of ChriÅ¿t were called, but he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿eth he was neither called, conÅ¿tituted, nor ordained a MiniÅ¿ter in Office, which I take for granted, and then is he to prove that they who were no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ters, either called, conÅ¿tituted, or ordained, were preachers of the glorious GoÅ¿pel; and likewiÅ¿e, that they who were preachers of the GoÅ¿pel, were not MiniÅ¿ters. But in this his ignorance, folly and confuÅ¿ion, are made manifeÅ¿t, for can a man be a Preacher and publiÅ¿her of the glorious GoÅ¿pel, and yet no MiniÅ¿ter, either called, conÅ¿tituted, or ordained? and can he that is no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ter, either called, conÅ¿tituted or ordained (as he hath confeÅ¿t he is not) be a publiÅ¿her, and a Preacher of the glorious GoÅ¿pel? Was not he a MiniÅ¿ter? And did not he make full proof of his MiniÅ¿try, who preached the Word, who did the work of an EvangeliÅ¿t? <hi>Paul</hi> was appointed a Preacher, and he was called to be an able MiniÅ¿ter; but <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> hath not been able by the Scripture to maintain that he is a MiniÅ¿ter, but enforced to deny the Å¿ame; and now hath given it under his hand, that he was not called, conÅ¿tituted nor ordained; therefore being no MiniÅ¿ter, he is no Preacher of the GoÅ¿pel, but in confuÅ¿ion. And it is much to Å¿ee what poor Å¿hifts the children of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s are put unto, now in the day of the Lords power, wherein light is riÅ¿en out of obÅ¿curity, and they that hate it are diÅ¿covered, and to the leaÅ¿t child
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62941:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>of light, made manifeÅ¿t and denyed. BeÅ¿ides, the GoÅ¿pel is the GoÅ¿pel of the kingdome; and to thoÅ¿e who were Preachers and publiÅ¿hers thereof, it was given to know the myÅ¿teries of that kingdom, which to others was in parables and dark Å¿ayings, <hi>that Å¿eeing they might Å¿ee, and not perceive,</hi> &amp;c. And the GoÅ¿pel is a great myÅ¿tery, which hath been hid from ages and generations, but is now made manifeÅ¿t to thoÅ¿e to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of that myÅ¿terie which (Å¿aith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>is ChriÅ¿t in you, the hope of glory, whom we preach;</hi> And by revelation, Å¿aith he, God made known unto me; the myÅ¿terie, and the hidden wiÅ¿dome of God we Å¿peak in a myÅ¿terie, which God ordained before the world unto our glory, and that which none of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this world knew, <hi>nor eye hath Å¿een, nor eare heard, neither hath it entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heart of man,</hi> hath God revealed unto them by his Spirit, who were the MiniÅ¿ters of ChriÅ¿t, and Stewards of the myÅ¿teries of God: But <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> hath confeÅ¿t, that he did queÅ¿tion whether he had received the Spirit, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and reveal the myÅ¿teries of the Kingdome unto him, and Å¿o to him the viÅ¿ion of all is but a Å¿ealed book, and to him it is but in parables, and dark Å¿ayings, as it was to ages, and generations paÅ¿t, to whom God revealed not the myÅ¿teries of his Spirit, but Å¿eeing, they did Å¿ee, and not perceive. And how then can he be a Preacher or publiÅ¿her of the GoÅ¿pell, yea the glorious GoÅ¿pel which is the GoÅ¿pel of the kingdome, to whom it was never given to know it, neither hath he received the Spirit, to open and reveale it, as is manifeÅ¿t un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his hand. Poor man! were he not very blinde, he might be Å¿ilent, and not boaÅ¿t to the world, that he needs not a proof of any man, that he is a Preacher and a PubliÅ¿her of the glorious GoÅ¿pel of the grace of God in <hi>BriÅ¿tol,</hi> who is Å¿o notoriouÅ¿ly ignorant of it, that (by his own confeÅ¿Å¿ion) he hath not received the Å¿pirit, to open the myÅ¿terie of it to him, as the Saints had in the Primitive times, and Å¿o is intruding into things he hath not Å¿een, vainly puft up with a fleÅ¿hly minde, and would needs be a Teacher, but underÅ¿tands not what he Å¿aith, nor whereof he affirmes, but confeÅ¿Å¿eth, he queÅ¿tions whether he hath received the Spirit, to open and reveal the myÅ¿teries of the Kingdom, and yet Å¿aith he is a Preacher of the glorious GoÅ¿pel, which is a myÅ¿terie hid from all, but thoÅ¿e to whom it is revealed by the Spirit.</p>
               <p>But he Å¿aith, <hi>his reward is on high, and that God hath given him a Å¿eale of his MiniÅ¿try in</hi> BriÅ¿tol, <hi>and he truÅ¿ts hundreds can Å¿ay, the Lord hath been, and Å¿till is with his MiniÅ¿try, quickning, comforting, teaching,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To which I Å¿ay, whoÅ¿e work is this, or of what is it a Å¿eale? In page 52. he confeÅ¿Å¿eth he queÅ¿tions whether he had received the Å¿pirit to Å¿eale, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet here Å¿aith, God gave him a Å¿eale of his MiniÅ¿try, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He hath before denied himÅ¿elfe a MiniÅ¿ter and now given it under his hand, that he was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther called, conÅ¿tituted, nor ordained, &amp;c. and yet Å¿aith, his Record is on high, and that God hath given him a Å¿eale of his MiniÅ¿try. Is he no MiniÅ¿ter? and yet hath God given him a Å¿eal of his MiniÅ¿try? What BabyloniÅ¿h confuÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion is here? Hath he a Å¿eale of nothing? or of a lye? Can he have a Å¿eale of that which is not? Or hath he a Å¿eale and not of the Spirit? Is not the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord (he Å¿aith) he hath of this on high, even with principalities and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Å¿piritual wickedneÅ¿Å¿es, where the powers of darkneÅ¿Å¿e rule? But how Å¿hall one truÅ¿t? or in what can one believe Å¿uch a man, who would Å¿eem to Å¿peak with Å¿o much Å¿olemneÅ¿Å¿e and Å¿eriouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, when he Å¿peaks Å¿o much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuÅ¿ion,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62941:28"/>contradiction, and falÅ¿hood: And well were it, that not not onely he, but ye all would learn to dread the name of God, and feare to take it, Å¿o com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly as ye do into your mouths in vain, to veile and cover your deceitfull pretences, leÅ¿t by him ye be not held guiltleÅ¿Å¿e.</p>
               <p>But he Å¿aith, <hi>It is true, I am no preacher of that, which you, and Å¿ome of your way call the GoÅ¿pell, namely to bid every man turn to the light within, neither did I ever read or heare that any of the Prophets, ApoÅ¿tles, or holy men of God, did preach Å¿uch a GoÅ¿pel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I Å¿ay, he being no Preacher of that thing (as he terms it) which my Å¿elfe and Å¿ome of our way call the GoÅ¿pel, he is no Preacher of the Truth of God, nor the GoÅ¿pel of God, <hi>which is the power of God to Å¿alvation to every one that believes.</hi> And Å¿o out of his own mouth let him be judged that he is no Preacher, nor MiniÅ¿ter, either by call or practice, who doth not preach that which we call the GoÅ¿pel, <hi>which is not in word, but in power,</hi> And no other GoÅ¿pel do we own, but that which is the GoÅ¿pel of the kingdom, <hi>the power of God to Å¿alvation, which is not in word, but in power,</hi> and is the myÅ¿te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hid from ages and generations, but is revealed by the Spirit to thoÅ¿e whom God would make known the riches of his glory, &amp;c. But, Å¿aith he, namely to bid every man turn to a light within.</p>
               <p>What then doth he bid them turn to, the darkneÅ¿Å¿e? and to follow the darkneÅ¿Å¿e? Doth he think that good Doctrine? <hi>Luke</hi> 11.34. <hi>The light of the body is the eye; therefore when thy eye is Å¿ingle, thy whole body is full of light; but if thine eye he evill, thy whole bodie alÅ¿o is full of darkneÅ¿s. Take heed therefore, that the light which is in thee be not darkneÅ¿s.</hi> Where there is a Å¿ingle eye, is not the body full of light? Where the eye is evill, is not the body full of darkneÅ¿Å¿e? And was not this ChriÅ¿ts doctrine, who bids people <hi>take heed that the light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them be not darkneÅ¿s?</hi> And were they not to take heed to that which was indeed light within them? of which the body was full where the eye was Å¿in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, and to walk in it. And the ApoÅ¿tle, who was a Preacher and a MiniÅ¿ter of the GoÅ¿pel declared, <hi>that the light maketh manifeÅ¿t the things that are to be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> And alÅ¿o that which may be known of God, is manifeÅ¿ted even in them vvhich vvere vvicked, and committed uncleanneÅ¿Å¿e, yet Å¿till they knevv the judgements of God againÅ¿t Å¿uch things. And is it not good to take heed to that vvhich manifeÅ¿ts Å¿in, unrighteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, and deceit, and brings to a knovvledge of the judgements of God againÅ¿t Å¿uch things; and if turned unto, and vvalked in, leads out of unrighteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e and all deceivableneÅ¿Å¿e: But the light vvhich Å¿hines in the heart, to give the light of the knovvledge of the glory of God he likes not to retain: But hath Å¿hewed his ignorance or vvickedneÅ¿s, if not both, and is joyned amongÅ¿t the vaine rabble, and vvicked company, not only of the people, but alÅ¿o of thoÅ¿e called Teachers, vvhich himÅ¿elfe calls an ignorant, ungodly, lazie, proud, Å¿candalous, Å¿oul-murthering MiniÅ¿try, vvho have made themÅ¿elves baÅ¿e and contemptible in the eyes of all good men, and in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ciences of many bad: And well were it, if he knew what that is in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ciences of many bad: which joyns with all good men againÅ¿t Å¿uch a MiniÅ¿try, who himÅ¿elfe with the bad is joyned in denying and oppoÅ¿ing the light, of which the Å¿ervants of God declare, and direct unto, and which the Prophets, ApoÅ¿tles, and holy men of God in Scripture did beare teÅ¿timony of, and that true light, and no other, do thoÅ¿e whom he calls <hi>Quakers</hi> direct unto, which
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62941:29"/>the Scriptures abundantly make mention of. The Prophets, <hi>who Å¿pake as they were moved by the holy GhoÅ¿t,</hi> preached and directed to the light, and groaned after the enjoyment thereof, Å¿aying, <hi>Ah! Å¿end out thy light and thy truth, and let them lead and bring me to thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacle,</hi> and accounted it mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ery enough to go to the generation of their fathers, and not to Å¿ee the light, which (Å¿ay they) <hi>was Å¿owen for the righteous.</hi> And <hi>IÅ¿aiah</hi> by the Å¿pirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheÅ¿ie declared, that the people that Å¿ate in darkneÅ¿Å¿e Å¿aw a great light; <hi>and upon them that Å¿ate in the Å¿hadow of death, hath the light Å¿hined:</hi> And that the light of <hi>IÅ¿rael</hi> Å¿hall be for a fire, and his holy one for a flame, which Å¿hould burn and devour his bryars and thorns in one day, And that a light to the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> would God give, that Å¿hould be his Å¿alvation to the ends of the earth: To which light the <hi>Gentiles Å¿hould come,</hi> and Kings to the brightneÅ¿Å¿e of his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing. And the Sun Å¿hall no more be thy light by day, nor for brightneÅ¿s Å¿hall the Moon give light unto thee; but the Lord Å¿hall be thine everlaÅ¿ting light, and thy God thy glory. And ChriÅ¿t, <hi>who is the light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world,</hi> Å¿aith, <hi>I am come a light into the world,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Believe in the light.</hi> And <hi>John,</hi> who prepared his way, did beare witneÅ¿Å¿e of him, <hi>that he was the true light which did enlighten every man that cometh into the world:</hi> And this is prepared before the face of all people, <hi>a light to lighten the Gentiles, to give light to them that Å¿it in darkneÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> which is the glory of his people <hi>IÅ¿rael.</hi> And after ChriÅ¿t was aÅ¿cended, and people were not to Å¿ay in their hearts, <hi>Who Å¿hall aÅ¿cend to bring ChriÅ¿t down? or deÅ¿cend to fetch him up,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Paul</hi> a MiniÅ¿ter of the GoÅ¿pel was Å¿ent to turn peoples mindes <hi>from darkneÅ¿Å¿e to the light;</hi> and to the light did he turn them, and Å¿aid, <hi>God who commanded the light to Å¿hine out of darkneÅ¿Å¿e, hath Å¿hined into our hearts,</hi> but to what end? Why, Å¿aith <hi>Paul, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God,</hi> &amp;c. But of this <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> is no Preacher, to wit, to turne people to the light within, which Å¿hines in the heart, to give the knowledge of the glory of God, &amp;c. But againÅ¿t this, Å¿aith he, came <hi>Henry JeÅ¿Å¿e</hi> from <hi>London,</hi> to eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h and confirm the people of <hi>BriÅ¿tol,</hi> &amp;c. This he calls the pernicious Doctrine of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and would perÅ¿wade his Reader, that thoÅ¿e who bid turn to the light within, do Å¿hut up the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven againÅ¿t men, and do thereby take them off from believing in the perÅ¿on of ChriÅ¿t.</p>
               <p>But this is an abÅ¿olute lye, and in this he is one with the <hi>PhariÅ¿ees,</hi> for they denyed the light, and oppoÅ¿ed the truth, which enlihgtneth every man: And he proclaims himÅ¿elf no Preacher of that, namely, to tmrn to the light: So in this is he joyned with the <hi>PhariÅ¿ees,</hi> to Å¿hut the Kingdome of heaven againÅ¿t men, by denying the Light. For no man can ever knew God, nor into his kingdome did enter, whilÅ¿t he denyed or oppoÅ¿ed the light in him, but they that entred did owne it, and the Å¿aying of the Reprobate is not much to be heeded.</p>
               <p>He Å¿aith, he <hi>Å¿uppoÅ¿eth we would have him give over Preaching, and come to our way, and that one told him hee kept many from receiving and embracing the light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I Å¿ay, He doth his uttermoÅ¿t to hinder, if his words or writing may do it, and with the God of the world, and all his MiniÅ¿ters throughout the Nations is he joyned, to do what they can to keep blinde the mindes of all that believe not in the light, leÅ¿t the light of the glorious GoÅ¿pel <hi>Å¿hould Å¿hine
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62941:29"/>into their hearts, to give the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of ChriÅ¿t.</hi> Yet indeed the good of his and all mens Å¿oules we do deÅ¿ire; but all his hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ie, falÅ¿hood and deceit we do deny: And if he own our way, which is the true light, the true and living way, his mouth would Å¿oon be Å¿topt for decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againÅ¿t it: And for all his denying it, he may once finde it a Å¿wift witneÅ¿Å¿e againÅ¿t him, it may prove as a fire in his bowels, and as a candle to Å¿earch his in moÅ¿t parts; and the condemnation it is of all thoÅ¿e that hate it, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture witneÅ¿Å¿eth. And ChriÅ¿t exhorts to believe in it, and in it did the Saints walke, and in it had they fellowÅ¿hip, which condemns the unbeliever: But of it he is no Preacher, and therefore do we confeÅ¿s he is no MiniÅ¿ter for God, for though in words he Å¿eems to confeÅ¿Å¿e Å¿omething of the light, yet like a man filled with confuÅ¿ion, Å¿peaks he knows not what, but uttereth his owne folly, and Å¿peaks of a two-fold coming of the Spirit into the hearts of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: The firÅ¿t is that by which the eyes of mens underÅ¿tandings are opened, and they turne from darkneÅ¿Å¿e to light, faith and repentance wrought in the Å¿oul, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Upon which I demand, were they believers before they were turned unto the light in which they were to believe, or had their eyes opened? If yea, prove it; If nay, then by his own confeÅ¿Å¿ion, there were eyes of mens under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tandings to be opened, and light to be turned unto; and yet he Å¿aith, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read nor heard that the Prophets, ApoÅ¿tles, or holy men of God preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Å¿uch a GoÅ¿pel, namely, to bid people turn to the light, &amp;c. Now how Å¿hall we truÅ¿t him? or which of his words Å¿hall we believe? who confeÅ¿Å¿eth he is no MiniÅ¿ter but uncal'd, unconÅ¿tituted, unordained, &amp;c. No Preacher of that thing we call the GoÅ¿pel, namely to bid men turn to a light within them, and yet the eyes of mens underÅ¿tandings muÅ¿t be opened, and they turned to the light, and yet Å¿aith he, to bid men turn to the light within, takes them off from believing on the perÅ¿on of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t.</p>
               <p>He Å¿aith, <hi>He adminiÅ¿ters the Lords Supper to this people in</hi> BriÅ¿tol, <hi>as they are a Church of godly Å¿ober ChriÅ¿tians believing in ChriÅ¿t, though Å¿ome of them miÅ¿-bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, not having light to Å¿ee right AdminiÅ¿trations, but reckon infant-baptiÅ¿me Å¿uffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient; yet as further light comes in, they are willing to walke up in it: In the meane time we can beare with them in love, as we deÅ¿ire them and others, to leave with us in other things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to it I Å¿ay; Though ye be joyned hand in hand in darkneÅ¿Å¿e and deceit, agreeing to bear with one another therein: Yet the children of light, plainly and clearly Å¿ee your folly and confuÅ¿ion, and bear witneÅ¿Å¿e againÅ¿t it. <hi>Tho: Ewins</hi> declares himÅ¿elfe againÅ¿t bidding turn to the light within! yet his miÅ¿-bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed people, as he calls them, have not light to Å¿ee the right AdminiÅ¿trations of BaptiÅ¿me, but reckon Infant-baptiÅ¿me Å¿ufficient, <hi>yet as further light comes in,</hi> Å¿aith he, <hi>they are willing to walke up in it.</hi> So then he acknowledgeth they want light to Å¿ee: And that, as light comes in, I Å¿ay, as it comes in, they are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to walk up in it (&amp; yet he Å¿ays) he is no Preacher of this thing, to wit, the light within. It is pernitious doctrine; It Å¿huts up the Kingdome againÅ¿t men, and takes them off from believing on the perÅ¿on of ChriÅ¿t. Poor blind man! how is he made to condemn himÅ¿elfe, in that which he in words is forced to allow. But theÅ¿e miÅ¿-baptized people, who have not light to Å¿ee right Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿trations, but reckon Infant-baptiÅ¿me Å¿ufficient, are his believers, and with one another can ye beare in love, in your darkneÅ¿Å¿e: It is like he knows in his
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62941:30"/>own conÅ¿cience that infant-baptiÅ¿me is not Å¿ufficient, being neither he nor you can prove it an Ordinance of ChriÅ¿t, and Å¿o follow traditions for Doctrines: And its no wonder that they want light, who follow Å¿uch a guide. who hath Å¿o plainly denyed the Å¿ame, and would fain be a Teacher, but underÅ¿tands nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what he Å¿aith, nor whereof he affirmeth.</p>
               <p>But he Å¿aith <hi>truly, I know no thorough-paced godly man, AnabaptiÅ¿t, or others in</hi> BriÅ¿tol, <hi>but do Å¿hew love and reÅ¿pect to me in their way, onely in this, they walke according to their light, and Å¿o do I; but they thinke I am too large in my principles, and I thinke them too Å¿treight in theirs; Yet,</hi> Å¿aith he, <hi>we doe not differ, but can beare with each other in love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> Here again is his confuÅ¿ion manifeÅ¿t: He denies them who bid turne to the light, and he is no Preacher of that, and yet his miÅ¿-baptized people want light, and thoÅ¿e he calls thorough-paced AnabaptiÅ¿t, or others, who Å¿hew reÅ¿pect to him in their way. They walk in their light, and he in his, and yet to bid turn to the light, is to deny believing in the perÅ¿on of ChriÅ¿t. Now let all who feare the Lord, conÅ¿ider his words, who Å¿aith he is no Preacher of that we call GoÅ¿pel, namely, to bid every man turn to the light in him: And the <hi>Quakers</hi> doctrine is pernicious, they Å¿hut the kingdome of Heaven from men; they take people off from believing in the perÅ¿on of ChriÅ¿t, by bidding them turn to the light in them (Å¿aith he) and yet himÅ¿elfe acknowledgeth the firÅ¿t coming of the Spirit is to open the eyes of mens underÅ¿tandings, and to turne them from darkneÅ¿Å¿e to light, and to work faith and repentance in the Å¿oule. Now according to his own words, are not they in darkneÅ¿Å¿e, and unconverted, who are not turned to the light? And is it not good to turn to the light, that the eyes may be opened, and the Å¿oul converted? And yet he is no Preacher of this.</p>
               <p>Again he Å¿aith, <hi>the miÅ¿-baptized people want light, but as further light comes in, they are willing to walk up in it.</hi> Here is want of light confeÅ¿Å¿ed, and the coming in of light acknowledge, and the turning to the light was before granted, and yet to bid people turn to the light within is pernicious doctrine. By this is the Kingdome Å¿hut: Oh miÅ¿erable blinde guide, and Idoll Å¿hepherd! how hath groÅ¿Å¿e darkneÅ¿Å¿e overÅ¿pread thy face? and thy Sun gone downe at noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</p>
               <p>Again, Them he calls <hi>thorough-paced AnabaptiÅ¿ts, they walke according to their light, and he walks according to his; they think his principles too large, and he thinks theirs too Å¿treight.</hi> Here is acknowledged their light and his light, and before, want of light, and coming in of light. And yet <hi>Quakers</hi> have done miÅ¿chief in <hi>BriÅ¿tol, and their doctrine,</hi> Å¿aith he, <hi>is pernitious,</hi> how Å¿o? why, <hi>they bid men turn to the light within them.</hi> Poor man! what is become of his rule now for turning to the light, that is pernicious doctrine. To try things by the light, were to deny Scripture to be the rule: But now with him, here is their light, and his light, Å¿treight and large principles, and mis-baptized ones that want light to Å¿ee right adminiÅ¿trations, &amp;c. But now, by what are ye guided? and where, and what is your rule? Have ye not all loÅ¿t it? and are all gone out of the right way, wandring ye know not where, in your imaginations, who rebell againÅ¿t the light, and know not the way thereof, nor abide in its paths: And in your own darkneÅ¿Å¿e are joyned, every one againÅ¿t the Å¿ervants of God, who bid turn to the light, which is pure, <hi>which lighteth every man that cometh into the world,</hi> which is no pernitious, (but Å¿ound) Doctrine; for if it be good to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62941:30"/>watch, and good to walk in the true light, then it is good to turn men to that light. And if the Lord would have all men to come to the knowledge of the truth, then it is good that all men be turned to the light, which Å¿hines in the heart, to give the knowledge of it, in the Å¿ace of ChriÅ¿t, and to bid peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to take heed to that light, to walk in that light, and believe in the light, which lighteth every man, that is Å¿ound doctrine, and thoÅ¿e that love not the light, nor walk in the light, nor believe in the light, are left without excuÅ¿e, and the light come is their condemnation, and by the light are they already condemned, who believe not in the light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world; and (whatÅ¿oever the falÅ¿e Prophets and MiniÅ¿ters of unrighteouÅ¿neÅ¿s Å¿ay to the contrary) is of little weight.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Robert SympÅ¿on,</hi> in pag. 33. declares, <hi>that that light which is in me, and in all men, if not put out, would tell me, that that thing which he there aÅ¿Å¿erts, is true.</hi> Now here is light confeÅ¿t to be in me, and in all men, and that light to be in all men, which is in me (and the Scripture Å¿aith, <hi>that was the true light which lighteth every man</hi>) which Å¿hould anÅ¿wer that which he affirms and minds to be truth, if not put out; And if Å¿o, then that is a good MiniÅ¿try which opens blind eyes, and turns from darkneÅ¿s to light. Then, it being Å¿o, what have thoÅ¿e Å¿ervants of the Lord done, for which thou Å¿o highly chargeÅ¿t them who are Å¿ent of the Lord, to bear witneÅ¿s of his name, and to declare his truth, and bids take heed to the true light, and turns to it to the opening of the blind eyes, that people may Å¿ee the way to everlaÅ¿ting life, and have their feet guided in the way of peace, with whom the Lord of a truth is; though <hi>Thomas Ewins,</hi> with the reÅ¿t of the deceitful workers, and MiniÅ¿ters of Satan (who love darkneÅ¿s, and hate the light) do reproach and belye them, he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering his confuÅ¿ion and envy againÅ¿t the innocent, telling the world, the <hi>Quakers</hi> (as he calls them) have done Å¿uch miÅ¿chief, and their doctrine is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious, they bid all men turn to the light, thereby to draw them from belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the perÅ¿on of ChriÅ¿t; and he is no Preacher of that thing they call GoÅ¿pel, and calls them miÅ¿erable deluded people. Oh vain man! who boaÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eÅ¿t thy Å¿elf in thine evil way; how is night come upon thee, and darkneÅ¿s over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hadoweth thee? And how art thou reeling and Å¿taggering like a drunken man, who haÅ¿t Å¿poken and written Å¿o of the light, thy Å¿elf, as is before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, &amp; yet art not aÅ¿hamed to belie and reproach the Å¿ervants of the living God, as thou haÅ¿t done, for labouring to turn people from darknes to the light, who having received a MiniÅ¿tery from the Lord, as all the MiniÅ¿ters of ChriÅ¿t did, not from men, as the falÅ¿e ApoÅ¿tles and deceitful workers and MiniÅ¿ters of Satan did; they labour, not accompting their liberties nor lives dear unto them, Å¿o that they may finiÅ¿h their courÅ¿e with joy, and the MiniÅ¿try, which of the Lord JeÅ¿us they have received and therfore in much patience, in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in neceÅ¿Å¿ities, in diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿es, in Å¿tripes, in impriÅ¿onments, in tumults, in labours by knowledge, by long Å¿uffering, by kindneÅ¿s, by the holy GhoÅ¿t, by love un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned, by the Word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteouÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s, by honour and diÅ¿honour, by evil report, and good report, as deceivers, and yet true, &amp;c. do they approve themÅ¿elves the MiniÅ¿ters of ChriÅ¿t, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿ed it is in the conÅ¿ciences of men. And <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> words, being ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿tly conÅ¿idered, with what is replyed thereunto, may not his own Å¿ayings be juÅ¿tly turned upon his head, pag. 49. may he not bluÅ¿h to Å¿peak or write Å¿uch things? Will <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the great and glorious God ever own Å¿uch railings
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62941:31"/>and revilings (to which I add) lying and deceiving, to be a teÅ¿tifying from him? Or will he ever juÅ¿tifie him in what he hath written and publiÅ¿hed? Oh! be aÅ¿hamed and confounded, poor deluded man; for how hath he manifeÅ¿ted himÅ¿elf a blind guide? They, (that is, the AnabaptiÅ¿ts) think he is too large in his principles, and he thinks them too Å¿traight in theirs, and yet they do not differ, but can bear with each other in love. Truly the Devil may love his own work, which is to lead people in darkneÅ¿s and blindneÅ¿s, and there have his inÅ¿truments fellowÅ¿hip. But will any man that fears God, and weighs his words, believe (or own him in) what he Å¿aith? How can it be that they Å¿hould think one thing and he another? he have large principles, and they Å¿treight? they in their light, and he in his, and yet not differ? And may not he be juÅ¿tly reproved, as well as the Authour of <hi>Satan enthroned in his Chair of PeÅ¿tilence</hi> in that they both agree to charge miÅ¿chief done in <hi>BriÅ¿tol</hi> on thoÅ¿e called <hi>Quakers.</hi> And <hi>Tho. Ewins</hi> is in that joyned with <hi>R. F.</hi> one walking in his light, and the other in his, yet they differ not, but are both oppoÅ¿ers of the true light, and the children thereof, who in the Å¿ame do walk as were their fathers in all generations. But in it are they both diÅ¿covered to be out of the right way, and the children of light, who walk in the light, Å¿tand witneÅ¿Å¿es for the Lord againÅ¿t them both, and that principle of darkneÅ¿Å¿e, blindeneÅ¿Å¿e and deceit in which they walk, and from which their corrupted works of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling and perÅ¿ecuting the innocent without a cauÅ¿e proceeds. But the day is come in which the Lord is gathering his people from Å¿uch (to give <hi>T. E.</hi> his own words) an ignorant, ungodly, lazy, proud, Å¿candalous, Å¿oul-murdering miniÅ¿try, who deny the light, and with the God of the World are joyned, to blinde the eyes of peoples mindes, leaÅ¿t the light of the glorious GoÅ¿pel Å¿hould Å¿hine unto them. I Å¿ay leaÅ¿t the light which God commands to Å¿hine out of darkneÅ¿Å¿e, Å¿hould Å¿hine into the heart, to give the knowledge of the glory of God, of which light, and no other, the Å¿ervants of God declare, and your folly is manifeÅ¿ting apace, glory to the Lord for evermore; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he that preacheth the GoÅ¿pel witneÅ¿Å¿eth the new covenant where the law is written in the heart and the Å¿pirit, put into the inward parts, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Å¿cripture witneÅ¿Å¿eth that the law is light and written in the heart, and that the word is <hi>within</hi> in the heart and in the mouth,<note place="margin">Prov. 6.23.

               </p>
               <p>And for his Å¿peaking of <hi>Sarah Latchet,</hi> &amp; aÅ¿king <hi>how</hi> I <hi>can Å¿tile her a Servant of JeÅ¿us, who is an ApoÅ¿tate, and an excommunicated perÅ¿on, going on in Å¿uch rayling, and calling him a deceiver?</hi> Another time Å¿aying, <hi>the prayers of the wicked are an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homination to the Lord.</hi> And another time let fly at him with a multitude of rayling and reviling terms, Å¿uch, as he Å¿aith, they uÅ¿e to give to the MiniÅ¿ters of the Nation, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To this I Å¿ay, In that Å¿he did bear true TeÅ¿timony againÅ¿t him, I own it as a Å¿ervice in the Truth, and her being excommunicated as he cals it, by thoÅ¿e

               <p>To which I Å¿ay, why Å¿hould not he be teÅ¿tified againÅ¿t as well as they, being at leaÅ¿t in many things found in their Å¿teps and practices: But for reviling Å¿peeches let him look at home. He Å¿aith, Å¿he called him Deceiver, and Å¿aid, <hi>the prayers of the wicked were abhomination to the Lord,</hi> and this by him is term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rayling and reviling, though it be according to the Scriptures, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from thoÅ¿e that Å¿pake <hi>as they were moved of the holy GhoÅ¿t.</hi> But he in his anÅ¿wer to <hi>Ralph Farmer,</hi> Å¿aith, the in-let and out-let, the fore-door and back-door of much of <hi>Englands</hi> miÅ¿ery, and conÅ¿equently of <hi>BriÅ¿tols,</hi> is an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, ungodly, lazie, proud, Å¿candalous, Å¿oule-murthering MiniÅ¿try, who have made themÅ¿elves contemptible and baÅ¿e in the eyes of all good men, and in the conÅ¿ciences of many bad. Now if this be Å¿o, the Quakers (as he calls them) did not all the miÅ¿chief in <hi>BriÅ¿toll,</hi> as he falÅ¿ly Å¿aith they did, for now he Å¿aith, the in-let and out-let, the fore-door and back-door of much of the miÅ¿ery of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>BriÅ¿tol,</hi> is an ignorant, ungodly, lazie, proud, Å¿candalous, Å¿oule-murthering MiniÅ¿try: And Å¿o hath he proved himÅ¿elfe a lyar, and a falÅ¿e accuÅ¿er, which the MiniÅ¿ters of ChriÅ¿t were not But who is the rayler and reviler now? They that bear true teÅ¿timony againÅ¿t him and his generation, according to Scripture? or <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> in Å¿peaking his own corrupted words out of his polluted and unÅ¿anctified fountain, who by his own confeÅ¿Å¿ion que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tions whether ever he had received the Spirit, to purge and purifie, cleanÅ¿e and Å¿anctifie believers, and make them holy: But if it be Å¿o, that the miÅ¿ery of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>BriÅ¿toll,</hi> is Å¿uch a MiniÅ¿try as he hath before expreÅ¿t, and which he terms the MiniÅ¿try of the Nation, ought they not to be teÅ¿tified againÅ¿t? and he alÅ¿o, Å¿o far as he is found in their condition? And may it not well be Å¿aid, that it is the great miÅ¿ery of many poor Å¿ouls in <hi>BriÅ¿toll,</hi> that Å¿uch ignorant and blinde guides as ye are, are followed, which is the in-let and out-let, the fore-door and back door of Å¿o much confuÅ¿ion, as is at this day amongÅ¿t you, one bearing with the other in your darkneÅ¿Å¿e, and in your Å¿treight and large prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, till ye become all quite blinde, and Å¿tark drunk in your imaginations, reeling and Å¿taggering, Å¿o that many poor people are even at their wits end, and have followed you Å¿o long, till their Å¿oules are even famiÅ¿hed, and they fallen into miÅ¿ery. But glory to the Lord God of life, who hath cauÅ¿ed light to Å¿hine out of darkneÅ¿Å¿e, and out of obÅ¿curity, by which the deceitfull veiles and coverings of the Å¿oul-murthering MiniÅ¿try are made manifeÅ¿t.</p>
               <p>And were thoÅ¿e Å¿avoury words for <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> to Å¿ay, <hi>It were fitter Å¿uch an
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62941:32"/>idle huÅ¿wife were whipt, and Å¿ent to Bridewell to worke, then to goe about rayling at people as Å¿he did?</hi> Let Å¿hame cover his face for ever, when he looks back on his own words, which are Å¿o well like the words and deeds of the MiniÅ¿ters of the Nation, which himÅ¿elfe calls the Å¿oul-murthering MiniÅ¿try, that he which reads, may eaÅ¿ily perceive them to agree, and that one and the Å¿ame Å¿pirit leads and guides them all. And did not <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> let flye at her in envy, when he Å¿pake Å¿uch words, and hath thus confeÅ¿t it, to his Å¿hame among thoÅ¿e that are not willing to joyn hand with the wicked, and to take part with evill doers: And for his Å¿aying that Å¿he curÅ¿ed and rayled, that is but the invented refuge of his lying Å¿pirit, for the words he Å¿ets down as hers, are no Å¿uch things. And for his charging her to be idle, that is from the Å¿ame root of lying, Å¿he having been known to be diligent in an honeÅ¿t employment, and lives not by others labours, as do the Å¿oul-murthering MiniÅ¿ters as he calls them, who preach for hire, and divine for money, and againÅ¿t thoÅ¿e that put not into their mouths, they prepare war: And take liberty to themÅ¿elves from their high places, to reproach, revile, Å¿lander and belye them that feare the Lord, and are obedient to ChriÅ¿t the light of the world: But if any who feel the burthen of the word of the Lord, and witneÅ¿Å¿e it, as a fire in their bones, and being weary of holding it in, are made to pour it out againÅ¿t the Å¿oul-murthering Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿try, &amp;c. For this, they muÅ¿t to the whip, to priÅ¿on, to Bridewell, &amp;c. And in this <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> is diÅ¿covered: And for his Å¿aying, Ã´ be aÅ¿hamed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, poor deceived man, becauÅ¿e I Å¿aid, Å¿he teÅ¿tified from the Lord: I Å¿ay his own words are turned upon his own head, and to bear witneÅ¿Å¿e in truth againÅ¿t his deceit, I call a teÅ¿tifying from the Lord: And it's apparent it reacht him, and his bottome was Å¿tirred up, to give forth Å¿uch filthy unÅ¿avoury words, more like a perÅ¿ecuter, then a MiniÅ¿ter of ChriÅ¿t; Å¿o that he may well bluÅ¿h, to write his own folly and confuÅ¿ion, for me his words reach not.</p>
               <p>But he would deviÅ¿e a thing of his own, and make a little Logick, as he calls it, to Å¿hew his skill, and to evade the thing in hand: And when he hath utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his abhominable lyes, asks, is this good Logick? I Å¿ay it is his own, and not being good, he may be aÅ¿hamed of it; for they that read his lines, may read his folly. He Å¿aith, in my letter I endeavour to parallel her with <hi>Paul,</hi> and her Å¿ufferings with <hi>Pauls</hi> Å¿ufferings, &amp; him with <hi>Pauls</hi> perÅ¿ecutors: All which is Å¿o notoriouÅ¿ly falÅ¿e, and from the father of lyes, that were he not paÅ¿t feeling, a man would marvail how, without bluÅ¿hing, he can write Å¿uch plain lyes, and untruths, when nothing like Å¿uch a thing appears in my letter to him, as the Reader may Å¿ee. In which letter I do not Å¿o much as once mention her name, much leÅ¿Å¿e do I endeavour to parallel her with <hi>Paul,</hi> or her Å¿ufferings with <hi>Pauls</hi> Å¿ufferings: But that which I did was, to reprove <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> for his unÅ¿avoury words and practices in oppoÅ¿ing the truth, and them that come to witneÅ¿Å¿e againÅ¿t his deceit, whom he threatned with <hi>Bridewell,</hi> with whipping, &amp;c. And by his fruits I tryed him, according to the Scriptures, &amp; found him out of the practice of the true MiniÅ¿ters of ChriÅ¿t, and directly in the Å¿teps and practices of the enemies of ChriÅ¿t, and his GoÅ¿pel, and therefore plainly told him it was the Devill that caÅ¿t the Saints into priÅ¿on; It was wretched <hi>Pilate</hi> that Å¿courged JeÅ¿us: It was thoÅ¿e MaÅ¿ters, whoÅ¿e gain came in by divination, joyning with the rude multitude, that carryed <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> before the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trates, and cauÅ¿ed them to be beaten, and caÅ¿t into priÅ¿on; It was JeÅ¿us that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62941:32"/>told his DiÅ¿ciples they muÅ¿t be Å¿o uÅ¿ed by the world, the generation of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, &amp;c. It was <hi>Paul</hi> the able MiniÅ¿ter of the Spirit, and not of the Letter, that proved himÅ¿elfe the MiniÅ¿ter of God in patience, in tumults, in Å¿tripes, in impriÅ¿onments, &amp;c. But it was <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> a MiniÅ¿ter of the letter, and not of the Spirit, that is, threatning the Å¿ervants of God, &amp; witneÅ¿Å¿es of JeÅ¿us, with Å¿tripes, with whips, &amp; with <hi>Bridewel.</hi> Now let all that read, but honeÅ¿tly conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, hovv from theÅ¿e expreÅ¿Å¿ions, and the like, a man vvho hath any fear of God vvithin him, can be Å¿o knovvingly wicked, as to <hi>affirme in print that I endeavour to compare her with</hi> Paul, <hi>and her Å¿ufferings with his.</hi> And hovv vvofully (it is like) by vvicked art, he can corrupt the Scriptures, and bely the Prophets, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tles, and holy men of God that gave them forth, vvho are deceaÅ¿ed, that dares to affirme things Å¿o directly falÅ¿e and untrue, as done and publiÅ¿hed by a man, vvhom he knovvs to be yet alive, and able enough to Å¿ee and diÅ¿cover his vvickedneÅ¿Å¿e. And hovv blinde, and like to fall into the ditch are all thoÅ¿e that vvill believe, or receive for truth all that comes from Å¿o falÅ¿e a Å¿peaker, vvho, I might eaÅ¿ily prove is far out of <hi>Pauls</hi> condition, vvho vvas a MiniÅ¿ter of ChriÅ¿t, and Preacher of the GoÅ¿pel, and called to the vvork. But <hi>Thomas Ew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins</hi> hath denyed that he is a MiniÅ¿ter, either called, conÅ¿tituted, or ordained; And therefore is he no Preacher of the GoÅ¿pel. <hi>Paul</hi> vvas Å¿ent to turn the Gentiles from darkneÅ¿Å¿e to the light. But <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> Å¿aith, to bid people turn to the light vvithin, is to cauÅ¿e them to ceaÅ¿e from believing in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on of ChriÅ¿t. And he is no Preacher of that, namely, to bid people turn to the light. Therefore is he no Preacher of the GoÅ¿pel.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Paul</hi> and the MiniÅ¿ters of ChriÅ¿t in meekneÅ¿Å¿e inÅ¿tructed thoÅ¿e vvhich oppoÅ¿ed themÅ¿elves. But <hi>Thomas Ewins,</hi> vvhen one came to oppoÅ¿e him in his deceit, Å¿aid, <hi>It were fitter Å¿uch an idle huÅ¿wife were whipt, and Å¿ent to Bridewell. Paul</hi> vvent into the Temple and Synagogues, to declare againÅ¿t them that held up the Idols Temple and Å¿hadovvs, from vvhence he vvas ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out, impriÅ¿oned, and abuÅ¿ed. But <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> Å¿tands up in the chiefe place of the aÅ¿Å¿embly, and PhariÅ¿ee like he Å¿tands praying in the Idols Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and Å¿ome that bear vvitneÅ¿Å¿e againÅ¿t him, he threatneth vvith vvhips and Bridevvel; and Å¿ome are haled out and impriÅ¿oned; for he confeÅ¿Å¿eth, pag. 58. in the margin, that one is novv impriÅ¿oned for diÅ¿turbing him: Therefore <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Ewins</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> are not alike.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Paul</hi> vvas not Å¿ent to baptize, <hi>but to preach the GoÅ¿pel,</hi> and to turn to the light. But <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> doth either baptize, as he calls it, that is to Å¿ay, waÅ¿h the outÅ¿ide of the people in brooks and rivers, when the inÅ¿ide is full of hypocriÅ¿ie, deceit and wickedneÅ¿s, not being Å¿ent, or elÅ¿e he was Å¿ent to do it, and from the light doth hee turn. And of that GoÅ¿pel is he no Preacher, therefore no preacher of that GoÅ¿pel which <hi>Paul</hi> preached.</p>
               <p>Again, it is the work of the Devil, the god of the World, to blind the minds of thoÅ¿e that belive not in the light, leÅ¿t the light of the glorious GoÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of ChriÅ¿t Å¿hould Å¿hine unto them, and into their hearts, to give the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the glory of God. And <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> is no Preacher of the light, but leÅ¿t the light which God commanded to Å¿hine out of darkneÅ¿s, Å¿hould Å¿hine into peoples hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, he labours hard to blind their minds with prejudice againÅ¿t the light, telling them, it is pernicious doctrine; they that preach it, Å¿hut up the Kingdom, and take people from believing in the perÅ¿on
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62941:33"/>of ChriÅ¿t. Therefore is <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> a MiniÅ¿ter of Satan, and a Co-worker with the Devil, in blinding peoples minds, and turning them from the light.</p>
               <p>And now all this being conÅ¿idered, will it be unequal for me to couple him with <hi>Ralph Farmer,</hi> though he would couple me with him, and Å¿ay, he wondred that I and they, who are Å¿o different in other things, can all agree to caÅ¿t Å¿tones at him; which is a lye, for I joined not with <hi>Ralph Farmer,</hi> to caÅ¿t Å¿tones at him, whoÅ¿e blood-thirÅ¿ty Å¿pirit I do deny, and with it have I no uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but in Å¿oberneÅ¿s and Å¿eriouÅ¿neÅ¿s I write the truth concerning him.

Surely there is an arrow that hath reacht the heart of the Kings enemie, he Å¿aith I writ a Letter to him, about a year ago, and now publiÅ¿hed it to the world in Å¿uch a Å¿ubtile manner, as that he who reads my title page, would verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he were Å¿ome dreadful PerÅ¿ecutor. Alas poor man! how is he handled and troubled that his works of darkneÅ¿s are made manifeÅ¿t, and his skirts diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered? Oh! Had the deceit been hid, and the wicked perÅ¿ecuting Å¿pirit been covered, he would have born it; but to have it publiÅ¿hed, that PaÅ¿Å¿ers by behold and take notice of it, this he likes not, but is Å¿orely troubled and wounded at it. And did he not, on this conÅ¿ideration, leÅ¿t deceit Å¿hould be made manifeÅ¿t, conceal the anÅ¿wers to the Antiquaeries, but Å¿uffered them to be printed long time after he received the anÅ¿wers, as if no anÅ¿wer at all had been given to them. Poor blind man! he is of a large principle, and can bear with thoÅ¿e that think vain traditions Å¿ufficient, and not differ from thoÅ¿e that are thorough paced in other things. But to be plainly and truly dealt withal, to have the deeds of darkneÅ¿s reproved and manifeÅ¿ted not to daub, not to Å¿ow pillows, not to cry peace to them that go on in their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. But to reprove Å¿harply, to lay open the skirts of the Whore, to cry aloud, and not to Å¿pare, but declare againÅ¿t tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ion and Å¿in, and to reprove it in the gate. O this is accompted harÅ¿h, the falÅ¿e Prophet cannot endure it, it diÅ¿turbs his peace.

               <p>And for the anÅ¿wers to the 16. quaeries which I publiÅ¿hed, and he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I own them, and not a word therein hath he diÅ¿proved, but tells me he might commend my wit in putting them forth after the man is dead. To which I Å¿ay, its like he writes one thing, and thinks another, which with him may be an uÅ¿ual practice. But how can I commend his honeÅ¿t dealing, upon a juÅ¿t ground, who had the anÅ¿wers delivered to him in writing, Å¿ome moneths before the quaeries were publiÅ¿hed. And was that honeÅ¿t or commendable for him, to be the conveyer of 16. Antiquaeries to me, and in Å¿hort time received an anÅ¿wer from thoÅ¿e to whom the Antiquaeries were directed, and either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal them himÅ¿elf from <hi>John Pendarvis,</hi> or elÅ¿e he neglect to take notice thereof, and in his book Å¿everal moneths after, publiÅ¿hed the Å¿aid Antiquaeries by the name of quaeries, as if they had never been anÅ¿wered; now if he had not printed the quaeries, or printing them, had alÅ¿o printed the anÅ¿wers, and Å¿o had replyed thereto; or, if they could have diÅ¿proved them, it had been Å¿omething like men, but to print the one, and conceal the other, is Å¿o abÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely foul and deceitful, that it was the cauÅ¿e of publiÅ¿hing thoÅ¿e anÅ¿wers, that he with all that were concerned in that deceit, might be manifeÅ¿ted. And if <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> will clear his fellow which is dead, he may, and then his own hypocriÅ¿ie will the more appear. And whereas he confeÅ¿Å¿eth thoÅ¿e quaeries
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62941:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>were once anÅ¿wered by another, and pretends the anÅ¿wers agree not: And that if four more had anÅ¿wered them, they might perhaps have come as near in their anÅ¿wers, as Å¿ixe of the Preachers of <hi>England</hi> might do, in their interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a place of Scripture: To this</p>
               <p>I Å¿ay, wherein do the anÅ¿wers differ, or how doth it appear that they agree not, for he manifeÅ¿ts nothing of it: And Å¿ince he could manifeÅ¿t nothing, why doth he give his tongue and his pen to Å¿landering? But doth one anÅ¿wer build up that which another throws downe? or doth one confeÅ¿Å¿e that which ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther denies? It's true, one anÅ¿wer may be larger then another, and good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fon, for there was Å¿omething in the Antiquaeries, which was leÅ¿t out, when they were printed by the name of Quaeries; and was not that a difference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themÅ¿elves, one while to Å¿end them by the name of Antiquaeries, and after they were Å¿o anÅ¿wered, to print them by the name of Quaeries. BeÅ¿ides, did <hi>Matthew, Marke, Luke,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> differ, and not agree? and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveable by him, becauÅ¿e of the thing of which they all declare, they uÅ¿e not one and the Å¿elf-Å¿ame words, and no more, but one is larger in his Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration then another: And whereas he Å¿eemeth to compare the Antiquaeries to the Scripture, and the anÅ¿wers to the meaning or interpretation the PrieÅ¿t put thereon, I Å¿ay, his compariÅ¿on will not hold; for the Antiquaeries, in which were lyes and deceit, are not to be compared to the Scriptures of truth: And if he be not wilfully blinde and ignorant, he may Å¿ee his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuÅ¿ion, and his companions, who are of differing principles, as much as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Å¿treight and broad, and yet, Å¿aith he, we differ not; and yet himÅ¿elfe would Å¿lander others in Å¿ecret for differing, but no wayes makes it appeare wherein.

For that GoÅ¿pel which the MiniÅ¿ters of ChriÅ¿t did, and do preach, and is indeed glorious, is the GoÅ¿pel of the Kingdom, and that GoÅ¿pel was and is a myÅ¿tery hid from ages and generations, but was and is manifeÅ¿ted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to them by the Spirit; which Spirit he having not received, the myÅ¿te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Kingdome, and of the GoÅ¿pel thereof, to him are not opened, but are hid, as it was from ages and generations paÅ¿t. And then (poor man!) what hath he to preach, or to miniÅ¿ter; or with what can he quicken, comfort and refreÅ¿h poor Å¿ouls, and turn them to God, as he Å¿peaks? Well may he feed them with aÅ¿hes, winde and confuÅ¿ion, with lying viÅ¿ions, with a viÅ¿ion of his own heart. And by a Å¿pirit of <hi>Divination,</hi> may he cauÅ¿e them to erre from the right way like <hi>Balaam.</hi> But with the bread of life, the immortall food, the power of God, the life and quickning of the Spirit, the hidden myÅ¿teries of the GoÅ¿pel, in which the glory of God is manifeÅ¿ted, he is not intruÅ¿ted, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62941:36"/>of it can he at all miniÅ¿ter, to whom it is hid, and not opened, nor reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And are not all thoÅ¿e blinde, and like to fall into the ditch, that are led by Å¿uch a guide? expecting to receive joy, peace, eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hment, comfort, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freÅ¿hment from him, who is out of it all, can do nothing vvell, but is dry, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren and empty, in the pollution and defilement, not purged, cleanÅ¿ed, nor Å¿an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, nor adorned with Å¿pirituall gifts, but is himÅ¿elfe out of it all, and gives it under his hand that it is Å¿o? And how dares he Å¿ay, his record is on high, and that many Å¿oules that lay weltring in their blood of ignorance before he came, are now turned to God: For although the children of the night, and of darkneÅ¿Å¿e may flatter, and pleaÅ¿e themÅ¿elves in their imaginations and lying vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ions, yet how can he be an inÅ¿trument to turn Å¿ouls to God, who (himÅ¿elfe) is out of all (&amp;c. as is before mentioned) and can do nothing well, nor knows that God, to whom he pretends to turn Å¿ouls, <hi>for God is light, and in him is no darkneÅ¿Å¿e at all;</hi> and thoÅ¿e that turn Å¿ouls to God, turn them to the light, for God is light, but of this is he no Preacher, but accounts it pernicious doctrine to bid people turn to the light.</p>
               <p>And whereas he Å¿aith (page 59.) it is his daily care and work to preach the Kingdome of God freely to Å¿inners, and the Lord JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t as the vvay to the Kingdome, and to invite and encourage poor Å¿oules to come into it, I Å¿ay, his ignorance both of the Kingdome of God, and of ChriÅ¿t the light which is the way, is Å¿een and comprehended: <hi>For the Kingdome of God cometh not with obÅ¿ervation,</hi> but Å¿aith ChriÅ¿t (who is the true light, and the vvay to the Kingdome) <hi>the Kingdome of God is within you,</hi> and in his Kingdome he is, vvho is light; and he that is the vvay, and the truth, the Å¿ame is the light, <hi>that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightneth every man that cometh into the world:</hi> And all that are invited and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to come into the Kingdome, are invited and encouraged to come into it vvhere it is, and that is <hi>within,</hi> and not in outvvard obÅ¿ervations; and thoÅ¿e that are encouraged to vvalk in the vvay that leadeth into the Kingdom, are encouraged to receive and vvalk in the light, vvhich is the vvay, ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us, the light of the vvorld; and Å¿o all that preach the Kingdome of God, preach it vvithin, and all that ever preached ChriÅ¿t, the vvay to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, preached the light, for he is the true light. But againÅ¿t all this hath <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> declared, not only his ignorance, but alÅ¿o his enmity, and Å¿aith, to bid people turn to the light vvithin, is pernicious Doctrine, of it is he no Preacher, and thoÅ¿e that preach this Doctrine, do Å¿hut up the Kingdome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t themÅ¿elves and others. Alas, poor blinde man! vvhat a pittiful thing (of a Preacher) is he, vvhoÅ¿e eye is Å¿o utterly darkned and made blinde, by the god of the World, to vvhom he turns, or vvith vvhom he keeps multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Å¿ouls, that novv the day is Å¿o much appeared, he cannot Å¿ee, but is groping as in the night, vvearying himÅ¿elf in his imaginations, Å¿tumbling at the light, which is his condemnation; but the glory of Gods <hi>IÅ¿rael,</hi> vvho receive, and believe in the Å¿ame.</p>
               <p>And whereas he Å¿aith, he preacheth that GoÅ¿pel of glad tydings, which ChriÅ¿t gave Commandment to be preached to all Nations, in which the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laÅ¿ting love and good Will of God in ChriÅ¿t is declared to loÅ¿t Å¿inners, I Å¿ay, that GoÅ¿pel, of which the ApoÅ¿tles of ChriÅ¿t were not aÅ¿hamed, is the power of God to Å¿alvation, to all that receive his love, and believe in the light; but againÅ¿t all that walk after the fleÅ¿h, according to the courÅ¿e of this world, in the imaginations of their hearts, not believing in the light, nor to it are
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62941:36"/>obedient, but hold the truth of God in unrighteouÅ¿neÅ¿s, the wrath of God is revealed, and thorough the GoÅ¿pel which is the power of God, is tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and anguiÅ¿h miniÅ¿tred to every Å¿oul that doth evil, and againÅ¿t all ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineÅ¿s and unrighteouÅ¿neÅ¿s of men, and the GoÅ¿pel of the grace of God teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to deny it, which GoÅ¿pel according to the Commandement of ChriÅ¿t, is now preached, not onely thoroughout this Nation of <hi>England,</hi> and the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof, but in moÅ¿t or all other Nations, I know in the world; Å¿o that the chief Cities and Seats of the Pope and Turk are not exempted; and the MiniÅ¿ters thereof have not loved their lives unto the death, nor accompted any thing too dear, or too much to Å¿uffer, Å¿o they may but finiÅ¿h their teÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and the MiniÅ¿try which by God is committed to them for the Elects Å¿ake, and from other Heathens do they receive the like meaÅ¿ure abroad, as they do from their own Country-men at home, and account it not grievous to Å¿uffer for the name of JeÅ¿us, whilÅ¿t the MiniÅ¿ters of Satan that work deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, deÅ¿troying Å¿ouls for diÅ¿honeÅ¿t gain, are at eaÅ¿e in their wealthy PariÅ¿hes and Lectures, living in pleaÅ¿ure and idleneÅ¿s, not Å¿erving the Lord, but their own bellies, and by pleaÅ¿ing words deceive the Å¿ouls of the Å¿imple, Å¿peaking evil of that they underÅ¿tand not, perÅ¿ecuting the truth, and evilly entreating the MeÅ¿Å¿engers thereof, for which they muÅ¿t give an accompt.</p>
               <p>And for what he Å¿peaks of <hi>Mary Prince</hi> (which he calls Mrs. <hi>Prince</hi>) accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing her of envy, hypocriÅ¿ie, railing, reproaching, jeering, Å¿coffing, &amp;c. I Å¿ay, Alas! poor man, why had he not firÅ¿t pulled the beam out of his own eye, before he had Å¿ought motes in anothers eye; for, <hi>Mary Prince,</hi> for many years paÅ¿t hath had, and Å¿till hath Å¿o large a witneÅ¿s, not onely in his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cience, but in the conÅ¿ciences of many other her enemies, of her meek, Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and good converÅ¿ation, beyond many, which he himÅ¿elf accompts the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, that I need not Å¿ay a word in her behalf, but let wickedneÅ¿s be upon the head of the wicked and falÅ¿e accuÅ¿er.</p>
               <p>But for what is Å¿he accuÅ¿ed (as aforeÅ¿aid?) why, for this, namely bearing true teÅ¿timony againÅ¿t his deceit, and (as he Å¿aith) called to the people at his Lecture, and bid them beware of him, for Å¿he had heard him Å¿ay, that he had not the Spirit of God. To which I Å¿ay, I never read of any of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿ters of ChriÅ¿t that were owners of a thing called a Lecture, but why doth he call it his Lecture, but becauÅ¿e for hire he preacheth it, and Å¿o the hire of about 24 <abbr>l.</abbr> a year, being his, he calls it his Lecture? But was it not good counÅ¿el Å¿he gave the people? namely, to beware of him, that by him they might not be deceived. Let the Reader, but conÅ¿ider and juÅ¿tly weigh what himÅ¿elf gives forth, from pag. 51. to pag. 55. and he may eaÅ¿ily Å¿ee how need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and neceÅ¿Å¿ary it was, for her that knew him well, to give Å¿uch warning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereunto moved; for if a man will take upon him to be a Preacher and a leader of others, who hath not received the Spirit of God, to open and reveal the myÅ¿teries of the kingdom of God, nor to comfort &amp; refreÅ¿h drooping Å¿ouls, nor to Å¿trengthen and encourage them with boldneÅ¿s to do and Å¿uffer for God, to purge, purifie, cleanÅ¿e, Å¿anctifie and make them holy and fruitful, and grow in grace, and fill them with meekneÅ¿s and love, and make them Å¿piritual, and unite them together, and to adorn them with Å¿piritual gifts and grace; nor to fill them with a Å¿pirit of faith and prayer; yea, if he hath not received that Å¿pirit, without which he can do nothing well; how exceeding needful is it that people be warned thereof? and how great is the love of the Lord, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62941:37"/>them warning in time? for what can any Å¿oul receive from Å¿uch a blind, unholy, unÅ¿anctified MiniÅ¿try that can do nothing well except it be by it to be led into the ditch and cauÅ¿ed to wander in the dark and blind paths of deceit and deluÅ¿ion towards death and deÅ¿truction, which is your own words to the Reader. And if <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> be not the man whoÅ¿e condition this is, and hath publiÅ¿hed himÅ¿elf Å¿o under his own hand, let the Å¿ober Reader judg; and Å¿o <hi>Mary Prince</hi> is clear of the blood of them that received not warning, and <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> his accuÅ¿ations turn heavily on his own head, but her they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach, who hath delivered her own Å¿oul, by giving them warning.</p>
               <p>And whereas he Å¿aith, I tell in my Letter, I was warned from inviÅ¿ible lights to beware of him, and that by viÅ¿ible light he diÅ¿cerned his Å¿peaking was but little acceptable to me and others, after he began to oppoÅ¿e, though before he was the excellenteÅ¿t man that ever I met with.</p>
               <p>I Å¿ay, what high and excellent thoughts he had of himÅ¿elf, may be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and becauÅ¿e he accounted himÅ¿elf Å¿o excellent, 'tis like he perÅ¿wades him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf, that I accounted him Å¿o too, in which he is miÅ¿taken; for, I was Å¿o far from it, that himÅ¿elf declares that his Å¿peaking had Å¿o little acceptation with me and others, that we were obÅ¿erved often to go out of the meeting when he was to Å¿peak, which is an abÅ¿olute lye too, though by reaÅ¿on of his flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, daubing and deceit, there might be cauÅ¿e enough, and grief it is to Å¿ee men of corrupt minds to oppoÅ¿e the truth. And for Å¿everal years, his preaching and devining, to me appeared Å¿o dry and empty, like other of the worlds Teachers, that is was truly a grief and burthen to me to Å¿it under it. And for what he Å¿peaks of my Å¿aying I was warned from inviÅ¿ible lights to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of him, it is a viÅ¿ible lye, in which he is too much exerciÅ¿ed, and no Å¿uch word was publiÅ¿hed by me, but that I was long Å¿ince warned from invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ible Å¿ights or manifeÅ¿tations, to beware of him is true; Å¿omething of whoÅ¿e woful condition was then manifeÅ¿ted, and may be accompliÅ¿hed, towards which he haÅ¿tens apace. But his enmity and hatred againÅ¿t the light, (which is the glory of Gods IÅ¿rael is Å¿uch) that he cannot but belye it. And to him I Å¿ay, that which God hath prepared before the face of all people, a light to lighten the Gentiles, hath diÅ¿covered and manifeÅ¿ted him no Preacher, nor Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿ter of ChriÅ¿t, but a perÅ¿ecutor of the life and power of God. And in the day of his diÅ¿treÅ¿s and anguiÅ¿h, which is coming from afar, in which the men of war Å¿hall not find their hands, but weep bitterly, in which the Å¿trong Å¿hall be as tow, and all hands be weak, and all knees be feeble, and all faces ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paleneÅ¿s, in which our God Å¿hall roar out of <hi>Sion,</hi> and utter his terrible voice from his holy Temple, before which all the earth Å¿hall tremble, in which the Lords Å¿alvation Å¿hall be manifeÅ¿ted for his people, in the deÅ¿truction of all his enemies; I Å¿ay, in that day, which is at hand, and as a deÅ¿truction from the Almighty cometh, Å¿hall he Å¿ee and know that by the Å¿ame Å¿pirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheÅ¿ie, which was of old, in the Prophets and holy men, and promiÅ¿ed in this day to be poured out upon Å¿ons and daughters, is hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And that it is not for nought, that the Lord hath Å¿ent his Å¿ervants, in his dread and power to warn the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though they turn not from their wicked wayes. And alÅ¿o that it is not for nought that thoÅ¿e Å¿ervants of the Lord, that Å¿tands in his counÅ¿el and receive his will (from whom God hides not the things he is about to do in the world) have not loved their lives unto the death, but given their backs to the Å¿mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62941:37"/>and their cheeks to them that pull of the hair, nor hid themÅ¿elves from Å¿hame and Å¿uffering, for their reward is before them, and their God is with them, whoÅ¿e acceptable day to them is manifeÅ¿ted, though the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Å¿ee it, glory to his name for evermore.</p>
               <p>And whereas he tells of his Å¿ucceÅ¿s and proÅ¿perouÅ¿neÅ¿s in his work, and the large room he hath got in the peoples hearts Å¿ince I left him, and the uÅ¿e he is of to the deÅ¿olate Church.</p>
               <p>I Å¿ay, in his work of deceiving Å¿ouls doth he proÅ¿per among you, more then whilÅ¿t I was there to withÅ¿tand his daubing work, who now leads captive a company of Å¿illy people, laden with Å¿ins and luÅ¿ts enough, who hath none to withÅ¿tand him, or tell how long; and woe for you was the day, in which the Lord left you to Å¿uch a guide, in whoÅ¿e hearts, that which makes deÅ¿olate hath room enough, and is of uÅ¿e to lead on towards perdition, which is the work of that which is neither called, conÅ¿tituted, nor ordained to miniÅ¿ter for God.</p>

And although I am not willing to trouble my Å¿elfe much with the filthy Å¿pirit of that worthleÅ¿Å¿e man, nor to take into the loathÅ¿ome channell of his monÅ¿trous birth. Yet Å¿eeing how abhominably filthy, wicked,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62941:38"/>and impudent he is in the buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e of <hi>ConÅ¿tant JeÅ¿Å¿ops</hi> removing out of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿h of <hi>Nicholas,</hi> in which I know he was a chief Actor or Sollicitor; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tanding by Å¿hameleÅ¿s lying in his foreÅ¿aid book, he labours to cover his deceit, and excuÅ¿e himÅ¿elfe, I cannot let it paÅ¿Å¿e; but (for the information of all thoÅ¿e that are concerned therein, who can believe and receive truth, and for the manifeÅ¿ting the wofull deceit, and falÅ¿e-heartedneÅ¿s of this loathÅ¿om man) declare, that notwithÅ¿tanding he there affirmes, that all he Å¿pake to me of that buÅ¿ineÅ¿s was, that the oppoÅ¿ition in publique was not fit to be Å¿uffered to hinder a Å¿ettlement, and to alienate mens affections, &amp;c. And that this was occaÅ¿ional by his coming to my houÅ¿e, and Å¿taying for the coming in of Mr. <hi>Cradock</hi> (as he called him) who (he was informed) lodged there, and that what he Å¿pake had reÅ¿pect to another brother as well as to Mr. <hi>JeÅ¿Å¿op,</hi> he Å¿aith, of whoÅ¿e caÅ¿ting out he did not know, nor had any hand in one way or other, by writing, Å¿peaking, or Å¿uggeÅ¿tion to any perÅ¿on whatÅ¿oever; and that outing and baniÅ¿hing from the City was Å¿o far from his expectation, and Å¿eemed to him Å¿o rigorous, that he publiquely taxed and declared againÅ¿t it, and that he never Å¿pake with me at any time after that occaÅ¿ionall diÅ¿courÅ¿e aforeÅ¿aid, which Å¿aith he, was before Mr. <hi>JeÅ¿Å¿op</hi> preached that Sermon, for which he was caÅ¿t out: And that he never uÅ¿ed that argument to me, that till Mr. <hi>JeÅ¿Å¿op</hi> was removed the City would not be in quiet, &amp;c. Yet after <hi>ConÅ¿tant JeÅ¿Å¿op</hi> had preached that Sermon for which he was caÅ¿t out, and after the Committee (of which I was a member) had queÅ¿tioned the Å¿ame; and after the buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e had there lyen Å¿till a while, and little or nothing done in it, by reaÅ¿on of his many friends therein that pleaded his excuÅ¿e, did <hi>Ralph Farmer</hi> come to my houÅ¿e, and (after his wonted complement Å¿et his back againÅ¿t my CheÅ¿t, and looking hard upon me, Å¿aid to this effect, Mr. <hi>HolliÅ¿ter,</hi> what do you intend to do? To which I replying to this effect, what do I intend to do; why? what's the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? why (Å¿aid he) about Mr. <hi>JeÅ¿Å¿op:</hi> To which I replying to this effect, what have I to do with Mr. <hi>JeÅ¿Å¿op?</hi> he Å¿aid he heard I lay Å¿till, and did not proÅ¿ecute him, or words to that purpoÅ¿e. To which I replying that I was no proÅ¿ecutor of him, neither did I hear him. But if any man had ought whereof to accuÅ¿e him, and brought it before the Committee when I was preÅ¿ent, it was like I might do what was juÅ¿t, or as became me, or to that effect. With which he not being pleaÅ¿ed, uÅ¿ed many words to provoke and Å¿tir me up againÅ¿t <hi>ConÅ¿tant JeÅ¿Å¿op,</hi> and at length, Å¿omething paÅ¿Å¿ionately or zealouÅ¿ly Å¿aid theÅ¿e very words (or to the Å¿ame effect) Mr. <hi>HolliÅ¿ter,</hi> I Å¿hall Å¿eriouÅ¿ly tell you my judgement: If you neglect to take the advantage of this preÅ¿ent opportunity for caÅ¿ting him out, I profeÅ¿s we are never like to have peace nor quiet in the City: And in many other words declared againÅ¿t his Presbyterian Å¿pirit, and the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e of it, and Å¿pake of his Å¿ubtilty, by reaÅ¿on whereof another opportunity might not be gained, if this was loÅ¿t, with much more of like nature: So that I may truly Å¿ay, that to my knowledge, I was not Å¿o much, nor Å¿o earneÅ¿tly preÅ¿t and Å¿ollicited by any other man whatÅ¿oever againÅ¿t <hi>ConÅ¿tant JeÅ¿Å¿op,</hi> as I was by this falÅ¿ hearted and deceitfull man, though he is Å¿o impudent and void of Å¿hame to deny it, and publiÅ¿h it as aforeÅ¿aid. And I Å¿ay again, all this was after <hi>ConÅ¿tant JeÅ¿Å¿op</hi> had preached that Sermon for which he was caÅ¿t out, and not before, as he falÅ¿ly pretends, neither do I know nor can believe he had any other buÅ¿ineÅ¿s in the world to me, at that time, but only to endeavour to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke and Å¿tir me up againÅ¿t his brother, that he might be caÅ¿t out: And that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62941:38"/>what he Å¿peaks of his coming and Å¿taying for <hi>Walter Cradock,</hi> is abÅ¿olutely falÅ¿e; for in many years together he lodged not at my houÅ¿e, but at the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, and elÅ¿e-where. Neither can I remember or do think that at that time he Å¿pake a word to me againÅ¿t any other of his brethren beÅ¿ides <hi>ConÅ¿tant JeÅ¿Å¿op,</hi> againÅ¿t whom his Å¿ole buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e was, thinking him not proÅ¿ecuted vigrouÅ¿ly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. And of this his coming to my houÅ¿e, and Å¿peaking as aforeÅ¿aid, or to the Å¿ame effect, other Å¿ufficient teÅ¿timony that then were preÅ¿ent, and heard, and obÅ¿erved it may be produced: And what I have Å¿aid, is true in Å¿ubÅ¿tance, and (as near as I can remember) in words and Å¿yllables. And it's true, that when the effect of his own Å¿olicitation vvas accompliÅ¿hed in his brothers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, (I was informed) before the people he declared againÅ¿t it, as if he vvere innocent, and had been no actor againÅ¿t him, vvhich to me appeared Å¿o loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ome a piece of hypocriÅ¿ie, deceit, and double-dealing, that I durÅ¿t never truÅ¿t him Å¿ince, but have declared againÅ¿t him, and to Å¿everall of his acquaintance manifeÅ¿ted much of the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of what is here publiÅ¿hed.</p>
               <p>But whether <hi>Ralph Farmer</hi> knowing himÅ¿elfe (in compariÅ¿on of <hi>ConÅ¿tant JeÅ¿Å¿op</hi>) Å¿o inconÅ¿iderable, that till he was removed, himÅ¿elfe had no hopes of preferment by that generation, did more Å¿ecretly endeavour his caÅ¿ting out, and when it was done, declared againÅ¿t it, that he might not be Å¿uÅ¿pected by his friends and people; but with the more eaÅ¿e might obtain his place, I Å¿hall not determine, but leave it to the witneÅ¿Å¿e of God to manifeÅ¿t, though time hath pretty well manifeÅ¿ted him, to all that are not blinde. And Å¿o far was it Å¿een before, that <hi>ConÅ¿tant JeÅ¿Å¿op</hi> himÅ¿elfe before he was caÅ¿t out; being in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with Å¿ome of the PariÅ¿h, and Å¿peaking of the buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e in hand, told them he feared that his place would be farmed over his head, meaning (as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿t himÅ¿elfe) that <hi>Farmer</hi> would get it from him. And of this his friend <hi>Thomas Bub</hi> (among others) may inform him; and all this I Å¿uppoÅ¿e was about the time, in which (he tells the world) Å¿ome of our powers were Å¿o great, that the life and death of mens preferments lay in our hands: And Å¿o it's like, for preferment, Å¿ake he did it, for which alÅ¿o, whiles he thought our power Å¿o great, he had a minde to be one with us then called <hi>Independents:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at another time applyed himÅ¿elfe to me, telling me he was convinced of the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of being in a Church-way, and propounded his deÅ¿ire both for himÅ¿elfe and his people (which to himÅ¿elfe he had gathered) to joyne with us, and make but one Church, provided, as he Å¿aid, that we would conÅ¿ent to the compleating it with officers, in which he Å¿pake Å¿o much that I perceived he Å¿ought for preferment among us, after which he had laboured elÅ¿e-where in vain, And therefore told him how vain it was for him to effect Å¿uch a thing from us, who (I thought) vvere Å¿o far from it, that before he could be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a member, Å¿atisfaction would be required touching his leaving a Church (Å¿o called) in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> &amp;c. By which (its like) he Å¿aw Å¿uch little hopes of preferment for him, through my hands, that I heard no more of him about the buÅ¿ineÅ¿s. But having obtained the end of his Å¿ollicitation, in his brothers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, he applyes himÅ¿elfe both to his place and people; and when, by the change of times, vile men were exalted, he rode over both, and conquered it as his own, and now calls it his, and Å¿o is become a blinde guide to thoÅ¿e call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and an enraged enemy to thoÅ¿e with whom under a cloak of Religion, for the Å¿ake of preferment, he aÅ¿Å¿ayed to joyn, whiles as he Å¿aith, the life and death of it lay in their hands. But, Å¿aith he, one of the Congregation
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62941:39"/>told him, if he would be one of the Congregation, he might be choÅ¿en PaÅ¿tor, and that Å¿he was told, if he might be choÅ¿en PaÅ¿tor, he would joyn with them, which it's like, made the man very confident of the buÅ¿ineÅ¿s, and was the end of his foreÅ¿aid propoÅ¿ition to me, notwithÅ¿tandinng all his feigned deceitfull pretences to the contrary, a thing Å¿o common and uÅ¿ual with that generation of hirelings, that who is it that may not Å¿ee it. But were they not wofully blinde that could entertain the leaÅ¿t thought of chooÅ¿ing Å¿o pittifull a piece of ignorance, confuÅ¿ion &amp; ambition, as <hi>Ralph Farmer,</hi> to be their guide, who had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proclaimed himÅ¿elf not able to preach for want of Books? &amp; told the people he could but expound till they came: And was it not my croÅ¿Å¿ing of him in his ambitious thoughts, and deÅ¿ires, that filled his heart vvith poyÅ¿on and rage, vvhich he poureth forth in Å¿o many corners, though in neither of his books hath he found vvherevvith to hit me. But all his lyes, Å¿landers, and falÅ¿e ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuÅ¿ations, being as light as vanity, and not vvorth the mentioning, do I trample upon.

               <p>But why doth he Å¿o much reproach, belye, and abuÅ¿e me for being a member of the little Parliament?

But a howling of the Shepheards had been heard, whoÅ¿e pride and glory had been Å¿poyled, and a year of rejoycing to the people had it been, in which no devouring beaÅ¿t had been permitted to live by the Å¿weat of their brows, not to devour the fruit of their labours; but every man in quietneÅ¿Å¿e &amp; peace preÅ¿erved under his onw Vine and Fig-tree to fit, without feare of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priÅ¿oning their perÅ¿ons, and ruinating their families, and eÅ¿tates, to Å¿atisfie the beaÅ¿tly luÅ¿t of the devouring PrieÅ¿ts, who like greedy Dogs can never have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. But to the everlaÅ¿ting Å¿hame of their profeÅ¿Å¿ion to all generations for ever, have occaÅ¿ioned more juÅ¿t and innocent men to Å¿uffer, and to be caÅ¿t in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to priÅ¿ons, and holes, for not Å¿atisfying their filthy deÅ¿ires, than is by all the reÅ¿t of the PariÅ¿h beÅ¿ides.

               <p>But why is he like the troubled Sea that cannot reÅ¿t, but caÅ¿ts up his mire and dirt at me in particular, as a member of that AÅ¿Å¿embly, he might know I did not there baÅ¿ely Å¿eek my Å¿elf, like the men of his generation, with the receipt of many thouÅ¿ands of pounds, as the Parliament records make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; neither was I baÅ¿ely Å¿ervile to the wills and luÅ¿ts of men, for prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Å¿ake, neither by fear nor flattery, love not hatred, Å¿avour nor frowns, nor any other baÅ¿e ends whatÅ¿oever, was I prevailed upon, to betray the cauÅ¿e of God, and Å¿ell my Countreys birth right and priviledges for nought, nor to enÅ¿lave my Countrey-men and poÅ¿terity for ever, to the arbitrary wills and luÅ¿ts of any, but as an EngliÅ¿h Parliament man did I Å¿tand, for the juÅ¿t rights and priviledges of the people, and a teÅ¿timony for them did bear againÅ¿t the tyranny and oppreÅ¿Å¿ions of PrieÅ¿ts, Rulers and other Tyrants, and that abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable monÅ¿ter of conÅ¿olidation (to the wrong and oppreÅ¿Å¿ion of the people, and the breach of the priviledges and Charter of <hi>BriÅ¿tol,</hi> to fill the purÅ¿es, and Å¿atisfie the luÅ¿ts of <hi>Ralph Farmer</hi> and <hi>John Knowles,</hi> whoÅ¿e hire already, its like, exceeds the BiÅ¿hops in come) I did not promote.</p>

And is it not known I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Å¿ought nor deÅ¿ired great things, nor places for my Å¿elf, but free to Å¿erve my generation, in place accounted by men leaÅ¿t honourable, and was Å¿orely grieved when tydings came, that I was choÅ¿en to Å¿it in Parliament; and truly may I Å¿ay, in more then an ordinary croÅ¿s I went. But the Scripture words were heavy upon me, <hi>viz. Thou therefore, ariÅ¿e and go, leÅ¿t I confound thee,</hi> for I did not know the Lords end in chuÅ¿ing me.

And doth not he know that although I have long time been in CommiÅ¿Å¿ion of the Peace and other powers, Å¿o that himÅ¿elf hath publiÅ¿hed that the life and death of mens preferments lay in my hands (for few or none beÅ¿ides of thoÅ¿e, of whom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And why then is he not aÅ¿hamed Å¿o baÅ¿ely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and belye the innocent, but that (as I Å¿aid) the fool hath Å¿aid in his heart, there is no God? But why had he not lookt at home, and among the proud men of his own generation, whom pride compaÅ¿Å¿eth as a chain, and violence takes hold as a garment, who compaÅ¿s Sea and Land for preferment Å¿ake, and know how to turn into all formes and Å¿hapes (true honeÅ¿ty excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) to obtain thoÅ¿e titles and Å¿hews of honour, which the people of God, by faith refuÅ¿e, and when they have obtained it, be-pride themÅ¿elves in their Airy Kingdom, vapouring like fooliÅ¿h boyes, to the Å¿hame and wonder of thoÅ¿e that are Å¿ober and wiÅ¿e, and the mighty pride of his own heart, as well as his envy, covetouÅ¿neÅ¿s, wrath and fooliÅ¿h madneÅ¿s, is Å¿o much manifeÅ¿ted by himÅ¿elf, and Å¿een, obÅ¿erved and judged by the men of his own generation, that I need Å¿ay no more, nor yet declare how proud and Lordly he is become, Å¿ince by wicked art he got <hi>ConÅ¿tant JeÅ¿Å¿op</hi> removed, and himÅ¿elf poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿or of his place and people, with the advantages thereof, that like <hi>Haman,</hi> all muÅ¿t bow to his Lordly Å¿pirit, or Å¿uffer, if he can accompliÅ¿h it.

All which with much more Å¿illy Å¿tuff, in which he is exerciÅ¿ed, together with his pettiÅ¿h, paÅ¿sionate, and unman-like behaviour, is Å¿o well known and manifeÅ¿ted, that what Boy or Girl of ordinary underÅ¿tanding, is there that Å¿ees it not? So that with <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi>'s words to him I may conclude, that the in-let and out-let, fore-door and back-door, of much of <hi>Englands</hi> miÅ¿eries (and conÅ¿equently of <hi>BriÅ¿tols</hi>) is Å¿uch an ignorant, ungodly, lazy, proud, Å¿candalous, Å¿oul-murthering Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿try, who have made themÅ¿elves contemptible and baÅ¿e, in the eyes of all good men, and in the conÅ¿ciences of many bad.

And when nothing appeared Å¿o like to effect it, as the art of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and devination, Å¿oon turned from ticker-making, and Å¿oliciting, &amp;c. to preaching.

And after a friend of his, beholding the unrighteous actings &amp; wretched dealings of this miÅ¿erable generation againÅ¿t the innocent, had bought and purchaÅ¿ed a houÅ¿e for the preÅ¿ent benefit of the impriÅ¿oned, I Å¿hall not now much mention the unjuÅ¿t endeavours of this evill people, both by offering to corrupt the Å¿eller thereof with large money, and with the Å¿ame to provoke the wife againÅ¿t her Husband, not to Å¿urrender, with other Å¿uch like deceitfull wicked practices, of which I have been informed, but leave it to the witneÅ¿Å¿e of God in their own conÅ¿ciences to reprove.</p>

               <p>And that the evill Å¿pirit of envy, blood and cruelty in the Chief PrieÅ¿t and Elders, may the more fully appear: The Warrant for apprehending and carrying the aforeÅ¿aid perÅ¿ons to PriÅ¿on, was committed to the hands of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Bayliffs, whoÅ¿e prophaneÅ¿s and wickedneÅ¿s I need not mention, yet they being conÅ¿cious of the honeÅ¿ty of their priÅ¿oners, promiÅ¿ed them liberty to go to their houÅ¿es, and order and Å¿ettle their buÅ¿ineÅ¿s, and meet them at a place appointed the next day. But having been a little abÅ¿ent (its like with the PrieÅ¿t or Elders, or Å¿ome of their evill generation) their minds were changed, and cruelty raiÅ¿ed, Å¿o that with much harÅ¿hneÅ¿Å¿e and threatning they carryed them away, not Å¿uffering them to go to their houÅ¿es to exchange their cloaths, nor abide where they were till their Å¿ervants brought them.

And the Lord hath Å¿een it, and is diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ed, and is putting on the garments of vengeance for cloathing, and is clad with zeale as with a chake, and according to their deeds, accordingly will be repay fury to his adverÅ¿aries, and recompence to his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, till they feare the name of the Lord from the weÅ¿t, and his glory from the riÅ¿ing of the Sun, whoÅ¿e Å¿pirit hath lifted up a Å¿tandard, when you, with the reÅ¿t of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are come like a flood.</hi> And why do ye garniÅ¿h the Å¿epulchres of the righteous, and think, if ye had been in the dayes of your fathers, ye would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the Martyrs and Å¿ervants of God: When truly ye bear witneÅ¿Å¿e, that ye allow their deeds, and are filling up the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure of their iniquities, <hi>That upon you may come all the righteous blood Å¿hed upon the earth from the foundation of the world,</hi> who are plainly found in the very Å¿teps of the former PerÅ¿ecutors, and at this day do hate, perÅ¿ecute, and impriÅ¿on the Lords people for that, for vvhich (among other things) the Arch-BiÅ¿hop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the BiÅ¿hops, Doctors, PrieÅ¿ts and Vicars did hate, perÅ¿ecute, and impriÅ¿on the Martyrs and Å¿ervants of God in former days, <hi>viz.</hi> refuÅ¿ing to Å¿wear at all, and declaring againÅ¿t payment of Tythes, of both which the Reader may finde inÅ¿tances enough in <hi>Foxes</hi> HiÅ¿tories, commonly called the Book of Martyrs.</p>
               <p>And becauÅ¿e every Reader may not have the advantage of reading thoÅ¿e Books being of Å¿o large a volumn and price, I Å¿hall give a touch of what I finde therein recorded, touching the teÅ¿timony the Martyrs did beare againÅ¿t the PrieÅ¿ts Tythes, and Å¿wearing, referring the Reader to the HiÅ¿tories themÅ¿elves, in vvhich he may finde it more at large.</p>
               <p>In the firÅ¿t book, pag 621. the fourth Article againÅ¿t <hi>Walter Brute,</hi> a famous Martyr, is, That he hath laboured to inform men and companies, that no man is bound to give Tythes or Oblations: And that if any man will give them, he may give them to whom he will (excluding thereby their Vicars.) And in page 622. another Article againÅ¿t him is, That Tythes are meer almes: And in caÅ¿e the Curate be evill, they may lawfully be beÅ¿towed upon others, by the temporall owners: And in a publique inÅ¿trument brought forth and publiÅ¿hed againÅ¿t the Å¿aid <hi>Brute</hi> (mentioned in page 623.) it is Å¿aid and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:62941:43"/>that the Å¿ald <hi>Brute,</hi> before the BiÅ¿hop of <hi>Hereford,</hi> did Å¿ay, hold publiquely, and affirme, that ChriÅ¿tian people are not bound to pay Tythes, neither by the law of <hi>MoÅ¿es,</hi> nor of ChriÅ¿t: And that it is not lawful for ChriÅ¿tians in any cauÅ¿e, nor in any caÅ¿e, to Å¿vvear by the Creator, nor by the Creature. And in pag. 632. <hi>Walter Brute</hi> having before his perÅ¿ecutors, declared againÅ¿t Tythes (manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ting hovv they belong to the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> and were not promiÅ¿ed to the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> out of vvhich ChriÅ¿t came. And of the change of the Law, by vvhich Tythes vvere once claimed, &amp;c.) Å¿aith, I marvail that you learned men do Å¿ay, that ChriÅ¿tian folk are bound to this Å¿mall ceremony of payment of Tythes, &amp;c. It's plain (Å¿aith he) that the Tythes were given to the Å¿ons of <hi>Levi,</hi> for their Å¿erving in the Tabernacle, and in the Temple of the Lord, as the firÅ¿t fruits were given to the PrieÅ¿ts. And Å¿ince the labour of thoÅ¿e Å¿acrifices did ceaÅ¿e at the coming of ChriÅ¿t, how Å¿hould theÅ¿e things be demanded, that were ordained for that labour? And Å¿ince firÅ¿t fruits are not now demanded of ChriÅ¿tians, why are Tythes demanded, except it be becauÅ¿e Tythes are of more value and worth then firÅ¿t fruits? And beÅ¿ides Å¿aith he, why are the Lay people bound to the payment of Tythes, more then the PrieÅ¿ts from having poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿sons of realities and LordÅ¿hips among their brethren? And again, Å¿aith he, If we be bound to Tything, we are debtors to, and bound to keep the whole Law; for, to Å¿ay, we are bound to one Ceremony of the Law, and not to others, is no reaÅ¿onable thing; for, Å¿aith he, we are bound to all or to none. And Å¿o he goes on, Å¿hewing how our PrieÅ¿ts were one with the PhariÅ¿ees, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving off the ceremonies of the Law, keeping onely the Commandement of Tythes. And how plain it is, that ChriÅ¿t was a PrieÅ¿t after the order of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiÅ¿edech,</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> not of <hi>Levi,</hi> and gave no new Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Tything any thing, to him and his PrieÅ¿ts. And when his DiÅ¿ciples Å¿aid, <hi>We have left all to follow thee, what Å¿hall we have?</hi> He did not Å¿ay Tythes Å¿hall be paid you; and that Å¿ince, neither by the Commandement of ChriÅ¿t nor his ApoÅ¿tles, people were to pay Tythes; it is (Å¿aith he) manifeÅ¿t and plain, that neither by the Law of ChriÅ¿t, nor of <hi>MoÅ¿es,</hi> ChriÅ¿tian people are bound to pay Tythes, but by the traditions of men, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The like teÅ¿tmony is born again Tythes, by (that valiant Martyr <hi>William Thrope,</hi> of whom the Reader may read more at large, in the foreÅ¿aid Book of Martyrs, where the largeneÅ¿s of his teÅ¿timony, the greatneÅ¿s of his Å¿ufferings, and the reÅ¿olution of his Å¿pirit for the Lord, againÅ¿t the PrieÅ¿ts and Tythes, as well as Å¿wearing is recorded in p. 693. It appears, he was accuÅ¿ed to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biÅ¿hop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> by the men of <hi>Shrovesbury,</hi> for Å¿aying, 1. That the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament after conÅ¿ecration was bread. 2. That Images Å¿hould in no wiÅ¿e be worÅ¿hipped 3. That men Å¿hould not go on pilgrimage. 4. That PrieÅ¿ts have no title to Tythes. 5. That it is not lawful to Å¿wear in any wiÅ¿e. And in pag. 700. the ArchbiÅ¿hop accuÅ¿eth him, for deeming holy Church to have erred in the Ordinance of Tythes, and other duties to be paid to PrieÅ¿ts. To which <hi>Thrope</hi> anÅ¿wers, That Tythes were given to Levites and PrieÅ¿ts by the old Law, that came of the linage of <hi>Levi,</hi> but our prieÅ¿ts came not of that linage, and that ChriÅ¿t, all the time of his preaching lived by pure alms, and Å¿o did the ApoÅ¿tles by his example, or by the travel of their hands; and that every prieÅ¿t that ChriÅ¿t approveth, knows, that the DiÅ¿ciple is not to be above his Lord, &amp;c. Upon which, Å¿aid the ArchbiÅ¿hop, Gods curÅ¿e have thou, and mine, for this teaching, &amp;c. To which <hi>Thrope</hi> anÅ¿wered, in the words of one of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:62941:43"/>their Doctors, which he Å¿uppoÅ¿ed was St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> That thoÅ¿e prieÅ¿ts that now under the new Law do challenge Tythes. do in effect Å¿ay, that ChriÅ¿t is not become man, nor Å¿uffered death. And alÅ¿o that (Å¿ince Tythes were the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges limited to Levites and prieÅ¿ts of the old Law, for bearing about the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, Å¿laying of beaÅ¿ts, and other obÅ¿ervations pertaining to their Office,) thoÅ¿e prieÅ¿ts that now challenge or take Tythes, deny that ChriÅ¿t is come in the fleÅ¿h, and do the office of the old Law, or elÅ¿e they take Tythes wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
               <p>Upon which the ArchbiÅ¿hop Å¿aid, They inforce people to expugne the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of holy Church. To which <hi>Thrope</hi> anÅ¿wers, Why call ye the taking of Tythes, and other duties, that now prieÅ¿ts challenge wrongfully, the freedom of holy Church? Since, neither ChriÅ¿t nor his ApoÅ¿tles challenged, nor took Å¿uch duties; and therefore Å¿aith he, all Å¿uch giving and taking ought to be called and holden, the Å¿laverous covetouÅ¿neÅ¿s of men, &amp;c. And when the ArchbiÅ¿hop demanded why he did not Å¿peak againÅ¿t Lords, Knights and EÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, as well as againÅ¿t prieÅ¿ts, he declares, that Å¿ince <hi>ChryÅ¿oÅ¿tom</hi> Å¿aith, that <hi>PrieÅ¿ts are the Å¿tomack of the people, and Å¿ince, by the vitiouÅ¿neÅ¿s of the PrieÅ¿ts, both Lords and Commons are moÅ¿t Å¿infully infected;</hi> and becauÅ¿e the pride and covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouÅ¿neÅ¿s of prieÅ¿ts, and the boaÅ¿t they make of their dignity and power, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿troyes not onely the vertue of prieÅ¿thood, in prieÅ¿ts themÅ¿elves, but Å¿tirreth up God to take vengeance both on Lords and Commons that Å¿uffer them, it's needful Å¿aith he, <hi>to be buÅ¿ie about them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Famous <hi>Wickliff,</hi> alÅ¿o bears teÅ¿timony againÅ¿t Tythes, prieÅ¿ts, &amp;c. who (as the HiÅ¿tory declares) had by his doctrin, born Å¿o large a teÅ¿timony againÅ¿t the proud, covetous, oppreÅ¿sing generation of prieÅ¿ts and perÅ¿ecutors in his days, that they greatly perÅ¿ecuted him, whilÅ¿t he lived, but by the power and wiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God was preÅ¿erved to dye in his bed, and Å¿o not being able to reach his life, they proceeded to judgement and condemnation of his Books, and certain articles they had collected againÅ¿t him; Å¿ome of which were, that he held, that Tythes (or tenths) are pure alms, and that the pariÅ¿honers may, for offence of their Curate, detain and keep them back, and beÅ¿tow them on others, at their own will and pleaÅ¿ure, and that the prieÅ¿ts are bound to get their living by the labour of their hands, and he that gives any alms to them is accurÅ¿ed, or in danger thereof; againÅ¿t whom the rage of the perÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors was Å¿uch, that 41. years after his death, they digged up his bones and burned them.</p>
               <p>Much more might be mentioned of theÅ¿e and others of the Martyrs and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men of God, who in their Å¿everal times Å¿uffered grievouÅ¿ly, manifold tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and miÅ¿eries, and loved not their lives unto the death, bearing teÅ¿timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for the Lord, againÅ¿t the corruption in doctrine and practice, of the prieÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of <hi>England,</hi> and particularly againÅ¿t Tythes, and Å¿wearing at all.

And by it may <hi>Richard Fowler</hi> and his Elders be tryed, yea, may try themÅ¿elves, in whoÅ¿e Å¿teps they are, and whether they are one with the Saints and Martyrs of God, who were evilly entreated, impriÅ¿oned and perÅ¿ecuted by the wicked

And whether, in honeÅ¿ty, <hi>Richard Fowler</hi> and his people ought not to deny and diÅ¿claim the Martyrs, and juÅ¿tifie their perÅ¿ecutors, or elÅ¿e repent, and own the Å¿hame of their preÅ¿ent practices, which by the teÅ¿timony of Martyrs is condemned? And if <hi>Richard Fowler,</hi> thinking to excuÅ¿e himÅ¿elf, Å¿hall pretend it was not he, that formerly was not free to take a pariÅ¿h charge, to be maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Tythes, nor voluntary contribution from thoÅ¿e that gave it grudgingly, and accounted perÅ¿ecution a grievous thing in the BiÅ¿hops dayes, from him onely to be Å¿ummoned to their Courts, though by them he was not impriÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that hath committed this villainy aforeÅ¿aid, but it was his two Elders, <hi>viz. Richard HolliÅ¿ter</hi> of <hi>Cop-hill,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Prigg,</hi> that have done it; and that he by Indenture hath let them his Tythes. I Å¿ay, if he thus plead, then is the wickedneÅ¿s of his heart, and the naughtineÅ¿s of his Å¿pirit, the more made manifeÅ¿t, who being convinced of the badneÅ¿s of the work, was aÅ¿hamed in it to appear himÅ¿elf, and yet would put others upon the doing thereof. And for him to pretend the letting his Tythes by Indenture, is horrible deceipt, and the prieÅ¿t and the Elders are not wiÅ¿e, who in their own declaration put into the Court, have Å¿aid, the LeaÅ¿e bears date the 17. day of <hi>March,</hi> 1656, when as the <hi>Subpoena,</hi> by which they Å¿ummoned the aforeÅ¿aid perÅ¿ons was da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted long before; Å¿o that either his zealous Elders and proÅ¿elytes were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining and perÅ¿ecuting their neighbours for Tythes before their Indenture was made, or they had that Å¿hew of a title, or elÅ¿e <hi>Richard Fowler</hi> himÅ¿elf was the man that did it, of which being aÅ¿hamed, he afterwards for a cloak, makes a pretended LeaÅ¿e to others, or rather the PrieÅ¿t with the Elders and people of <hi>WeÅ¿terleigh,</hi> conÅ¿ult and agree to perÅ¿ecute the innocent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Å¿upplication was made that they might be Å¿ent for, and commanded to Å¿wear how may eggs and apples were due to <hi>Richard Fowler,</hi> which they in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to ChriÅ¿t refuÅ¿ing to do, for whoÅ¿e name Å¿ake they Å¿uffer; preÅ¿ently Å¿olicitation was made, that power be given to caÅ¿t them into priÅ¿on, as it was by the wicked <hi>Caldaeans,</hi> to caÅ¿t the three children into the firery furnace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becauÅ¿e to the Lord they Å¿tood faithful, &amp; did not bow to that to which by the command of the BabyloniÅ¿h King, they were required, and Å¿o the Scripture is fulfilled, and the Devil hath caÅ¿t Å¿ome into priÅ¿on, where being faithful unto death, they will receive the crown of life in the approaching day, in which the cruel BeaÅ¿t, the falÅ¿e Prophet, and thoÅ¿e that make war with the Lamb, is to be caÅ¿t alive into the lake, and tormented for evermore.</p>
               <p>But hath <hi>Richard Fowler</hi> done honeÅ¿tly, or as he would be done unto in this matter? If yea, why then did he cry out of violence and wrong, of grievouÅ¿neÅ¿s and perÅ¿ecution, when by the former perÅ¿ecutors he was much more tenderly dealt withal, and not commanded to Å¿wear to accuÅ¿e himÅ¿elf,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62941:44"/>nor was ever impriÅ¿oned for refuÅ¿ing thereof? And would he not have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted it a vile and a moÅ¿t wicked thing in the BiÅ¿hops and their generation, if they by their means and intereÅ¿t, had not onely caÅ¿t him into priÅ¿on, but his family out of doors, uÅ¿ing all means they were able, Å¿o unjuÅ¿tly to ruinate, Å¿poyle and undo him in his outward eÅ¿tate, whilÅ¿t they kept him in bonds, and that for Å¿o Å¿mall a matter, as a few Tythe-apples and eggs, &amp;c. unjuÅ¿tly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded?

               <p>And did not he know, or believe, that <hi>Richard HolliÅ¿ter, Richard Atwood, Henry AlÅ¿op,</hi> and <hi>John Champneys,</hi> could not in conÅ¿cience Å¿wear at all, before he occaÅ¿ioned that requeÅ¿t to the Court, that they might be Å¿ent for and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to Å¿wear?
