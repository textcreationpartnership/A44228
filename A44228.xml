         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Likewiſe an Anſwer to <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> his word, in the cloſe of the ſaid book, in which he acknowledgeth himſelf no Miniſter, and is proved no preacher of the Goſpel, but in confuſion, and a Miniſter of Satan, and <hi>Robert Purnel</hi> a falſe prophet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

But
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62941:3"/>after I had waited ſeveral dayes and found that notwithſtanding anguiſh and torment were upon you, who in your conſciences were ſmitten and wounded, ſo that ſome durſt not read my book, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently returned it; others beginning to read, could not, but laid it aſide, others reading it, ſhed more tears, then they read lines, (as themſelves have ſaid) and yet againſt it hardened themſelves, and repented not: And others reading it, and reproved by it, fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to much rage and fury, and therein publiſhing it themſelves amongſt their rude companions, endeavouring to raiſe lies and falſehood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. I ſay, when theſe and ſuch like effects appeared, and not till then, I conſented to the making my books publick, by which I perceive the ſence of guilt, and ſo of torment being encreaſed, you grew exceeding angry and wrathful: But if ye had ſtood in that which convinced, its like I had no longer, in publick view conteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe I do neither deſire, nor endeavour your deſtruction, but your ſalvation (God is witneſs.) Neither in a ſpirit of anger and bitterneſs am I dealing with you, whoſe welfare I am ſeeking, not your hurt: But in the fear of the Lord am I faithfully dealing with you, (of whoſe ſtate and condition I am not ignorant) not daring to uſe flattering and deceitful ſpeeches, as others do, crying peace and ſafety to that againſt which (I know) the wrath and righteous judgement of God is near to be revealed; but in much plainneſs, in a ſpirit of ſoberneſs and moderation do I tell you the truth, and (whether ye will hear or forbear) the time is at hand in which ye muſt witneſs it, notwithſtanding (to hide your ſelves and cover your ſhame) ye are ſtriving to recover your Vail, and vindicate your ſelves: And (having given heed to many falſe ſeducing and lying ſpirits) ye have writen a book for that purpoſe, which I received from you by the hand of a ſtranger, ſuppoſing the conſcience ye had of the deceit and falſhood ye therein uſed ſo far prevailed, that none among your ſelves could appear to deliver it. But your Book I have peruſed, and do find that your buſineſs therein is, not to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer mine, entituled <hi>The skirits of the Whore diſcovered:</hi> But by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty and deceit, the ſpirit of falſhood and lying to cover and vail your ſelves from the ſtroak of that truth, which by demonſtration and plainneſſe, is therein declared, and manifeſted againſt you: So that (although I had much rather be quiet, waiting on the Lord, than to be thus contending, yet for the ſake of truth and further manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the deceit and hypocreſie which abounds among you) I am once more by you conſtrained to appear in the publick war which (in this mighty day of the Lords power) is begun, between <hi>the Beaſt, the falſ-Prophet, and the Lamb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. And firſt I muſt tell you, that (notwithſtanding <hi>1</hi> adviſed and warned you in my former book, that if ye returned an anſwer, ye take care, it be to ſome purpoſe, and not a parcel of weakneſs, and confuſion, &amp;c. yet) I find the conception and birth, which by you
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62941:3"/>(who call your ſelves a Church of Chriſt) is brought forth into the world, is the ſame in which you have given ſo much advantage, to lay open your ſhame, and diſcover your ſkirts, beyond and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove others, yea many of the Pariſh Aſſemblies of which you ſpeak; that I know not how to let it paſs without rebuke.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I take notice that that little book (entituled <hi>The skirts of the Whore diſcovered</hi>) hath been made effectuall (through the power of the mighty God of <hi>Jacob</hi>) ſo that the dart is ſtruck through the liver, and the arrowes of the Almighty ſtick faſt in the hearts of the Kings enemy, and torment is upon you on every ſide, becauſe your ſkirts are diſcovered, that paſſers by ſee the ſhame of your nakedneſs, and that (inſtead of turning unto the Lord who hath ſmitten and wounded you, whoſe tender mercies are towards you, and therefore hath often warned you) with fooliſh <hi>Ephraim</hi> of old, you are running to the <hi>Aſſrians</hi> for help, and into <hi>Aegypts</hi> land a place of darkneſs are ye gone, ſeeking to recover a vail to hide your ſelves from the face of the Lamb, who is the Light of the World and of the Temple, in whoſe light ye are ſeen and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, and the deceit of your Religion and powerleſs profeſſion known and manifeſted, againſt which the hand of the Lord is lifted up, though ye ſee it not, nor are aſhamed, but (under your tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and deceitful forms and waies) ſeek to hide and cover your ſelves, as with a vail, making lies your refuge, and under falſhood hiding your ſelves, bringing the wo and the wrath more and more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your ſelves, who cover with a covering, but not of Gods ſpirit, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beling againſt the light not knowing its wais, nor abiding in its paths.</p>

All which is the proper fruit of the corrupt fountain, from whence it came, to which it is again returned. But by this the ſober Reader may take notice, how directly ye are found in the ſteps of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who crucified the juſt one, and ſaid and did not, &amp;c. And what uſe it is ye make of Chriſt his precepts and examples, that is to ſay, to make them a veil or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, under pretence of which to hide your ſelves in your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly and wicked practices, whiles in words ye would ſeem to condemn it, juſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>To your Reader ye expreſse your trouble and grieſe, that I, a man once famous for profeſſing the truth, did, upon the coming of the people called</hi> Quakers, <hi>own and plead for them, and by ſo doing drew many a poor ſoul, out of the wayes of Chriſt (as ye ſay) into the wayes of thoſe miſerable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I reply, that I did (upon the firſt publiſhing of the glad tydings of ſalvation, by the Miniſterie of righteouſneſs) obtain mercy, to own and embrace the ſame, and by it was turned to God, out of the wayes of miſerie, deluſion and deceipt, in which ye yet abide, is true: But that I drew any out of the wayes of Chriſt, is falſe, and from your father, by whom the eyes of your minds being blinded, ye wander, and by him are led in the dark and blind pathes of lying deceipt, and deluſion, towards death and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62941:5"/>deſtruction. And therefore ye tell the Reader I prepared a letre. with this inſcription, <hi>for the people called independents,</hi> and by my ſubtilty engaged two of your brethren, to preſent it to the Church, which is an abſolute lye, at which ye could not but bluſh, had ye not a whoores forhead, for no ſuch inſcription at all, was upon any letter of mine. But <hi>for the hands of Robert Simpſon and Robert Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, &amp;c.</hi> Neither do I know any ſubtilty uſed to engage them, far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than in plainnes and honeſty to read it in their hearing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand their freedom to comunicate it to thoſe who ſent the charge by them to me, and this ye term ſubtility and deceipt, when the ſubtilty and deſigned deceipt is among your ſelves, who kept my defence from being communicated to thoſe, for whom it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, fearing (as ye confeſſe, it might draw away more from amongſt you: And this was no diſappointment at all of my ends, neither was I enraged at it (as ye ſay,) But it is another lye, and your torment thereby is encreaſed, becauſe opportunity was thereby adminiſtred, to diſcover your ſkirts, and lay open your ſhame, which otherwiſe (its like) had not been. And whereas ye tell your Reader, ye cannot without being guilty of my ſin, let my folly go unreproved, but have ſet forth theſe plain words of truth and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernes, &amp;c. This is like the reſt, a refuge of lyes, for neither true, nor ſober it is, but full of lyes and deceipt, of which I know no page free. And ſo ye need not trouble your ſelves, with the guilt of my ſin, ye have enough of your own. And it is plain and true, that the lyers are without, and for the lake, &amp;c. which is your portion, from him who will clear the innocent, &amp;c. with whom ye are not companions in tribulation, nor are grieved for the afflictions of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> nor ſenſible of this day of <hi>Jacobs</hi> trouble; nor know the welfare of <hi>Sion,</hi> nor the faith of the Goſpel, nor the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> which is the Spirit of prophecie.</p>
            <p>And ſo I come to your book it ſelf, In the firſt line of which ye demand, Did I never read, that the Church of Chriſt in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is reſembled to a natural body, wherein are many members united each to other, and moſt of them to one head and by one Spirit, and ſay, that as in the natural body; there may be many infirmities, ſo in the miſtical bodie? &amp;c. I anſwer nay, I never read ſuch a thing in Scripture, but can read you who put this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton, as blind as the men of <hi>Sodom,</hi> that ſaw not the way; for, where in Scripture, is the Church of Chriſt reſembled to a natural body, I ſay, a natural bodie in which are many infirmities? Again, where doth the Scripture ſay, that in the Church of Chriſt, there are many members united each to other, and [moſt] of them to one head, and by one ſpirit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>? Is there any unitie in the Church of Chriſt, and not by the Spirit? And are not all who are by the Spirit united together, by the ſame Spirit united to the head? And is not the Lord that Spirit, in which the vail is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62941:5"/>But <hi>Babilon</hi> is your Citie; your firſt building is confuſion, and had ye not thus expreſt your ſelves, ye had not ſo clearly manifeſted your groſs ignorance, both of the true Church, her members, the head, and the Spirit. But having thus done, ye apply your ſelves to your blind miſtaken concluſions, drawn from what before ye had ignorantly propounded, And ſay, that as in the natural bodie there may be many infirmities, ſo the myſtical body alſo may be ſubject to diſtempers, &amp;c. To which I ſay, In your tittle page ye ſtile your ſelves <hi>the Church of Chriſt</hi> (though ye never proved it) but your language is the harlots, and not the Churches; In Scripture I read of a natural bodie and a ſpiritual bodie, but never of a myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal bodie ſo expreſt (that comes from the Harlot.) But if by myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal bodie ye mean your ſelves, then I eaſily grant, it is indeed ſubject to deſtempers enough, which ye number up; and ſay, is undigeſted humours, want of cloſing with truth, and receiving un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, windie humours of pride, high-mindedneſs, and giving heed to lying Spirits, violent headineſs, in ſtead of well tempered zeal for God and godlineſs, &amp;c. All which (it's like) ye ſpeak from good experience, and if ye had added much more of that kind, to which ye are ſubject, I know and bear teſtimonie that it is true. But if by myſtical bodie, ye mean the Church of Chriſt, of which he is head, and hath waſhed from all her ſins in his own blood, and redeemed from all iniquitie, and preſents holy and unblamable; without ſpot or wrinkle, then do ye ſpeak falſely and wickedly, blaſpeming the bodie of Chriſt, which is holy, in which dwell no lying ſpirits nor windie homours (as ye call it) of pride and high mindedneſs, &amp;c much leſse is it ſubject to thoſe things, but is more than Conqueror over it, and is ſubject onely to Chriſt who is the head, where other Lords have not dominion, but being made free by the Son of God, is free indeed, while ſuch as you are ſubject to ſuch diſtempers and wicked ſpirits and humours, by which ye are overcome, and in bondage, and never came to witneſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and freedom by the Son of God, who gave himſelf for us, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himſelf a peculiar people,</hi> Now if <hi>Pauls</hi> words be true, as indeed they are, then is your myſtical diſtempered, ſurfeited, windie humo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rous, proud, high minded, feavoriſh bodie, which gives heed to lying ſpirits, no Church of Chriſt, but an abſolute Harlot, And ſo have ye your ſelves manifeſted your own bodie as filthy as ever I declared it; And ſo what wrong have I done ye? ye ſay in my former book there is contained many things <hi>too low, and beneath you to read, peruſe or anſwer,</hi> thereby manifeſting your Pride; for his ſoul that is lifted up, is not upright. And the Harlot ſits as a Queen, and counts it beneath her, to anſwer what is ſpoken to her in truth; But I perceive ye are making good the title of your book, covering your ſelves with ſuch filthie ſtuff, where ye cannot anſwer, and yet he that reads and underſtands, would think ye little regard what
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62941:6"/>ye ſay, or into what confuſion ye run, ſo ye can but think to hide your heads, for notwithſtanding ye ſaid but now it was below and beneath a Chriſtian, much more a whole Church, to read, or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer my book; yet preſently ye ſay, ye ſhall take the Lords Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and anſwer the Author: Is it beneath and too low for you to read or anſwer, and yet doth the Lord Counſel you to anſwer? or doth the Lord Counſel you to anſwer what is beneath you to read? Why ſhould ye thus take the Lords name in vain to cover and hide your deceipt? Know ye not that ye cannot be by him held guiltleſs?

            <p>To which I reply, The aſſemblyes and Churches of Saints, oh how lovely are they unto me? becauſe the living preſence and power of God is there manifeſted; In which I have choſen rather to be <hi>a door-keeper, and to ſuffer reproach with the people of God,</hi> (which

But the voice of the Lords thunders being heard in the earth, and his lightenings gone forth, and his juſt viſitations come and coming upon the Harlot or great whore, whoſe judgement is now come, I doe, according to my meaſure, bear teſtimony againſt her (your ſurfeited bodie) though ſhe call her ſelf a Church, and cover her ſelf with ſcarlet, as with a veil, yet upon her neck do I tread, and all her glorie do I deſpiſe, and upon all her pride and Luciferian ſpirit do I trample, for juſt and true is he that hath judged her.

And if we reprove them, will they not ſay, one of your ſelves have written and publiſhed it?

But being a little rebuked by the power and ſpirit of the living God, ye begin to crye out; and ſay who hath his tongue unteid, and doth not ſpeak to vindicate the undeceived innocencie, &amp;c.? (As if in one hour your glorie becautie, and coſtly attire were laid in the duſt) and that if it had been a <hi>Turk, a Heathen,</hi> or an open enemy, that had done this, ye could have born it, and ſo tell of ſifting up my heel againſt Chriſt, crucifying him a freſh, and putting him to

            <p>Reply. Did I therefore act like <hi>Judas</hi> and betray you, becauſe I called you friends, and in faithfulneſs told you the truth? Know ye not that it was the word of Chriſt to <hi>Judas,</hi> who was the betraier, and never the word of the betraier, to the betrayed one. And do ye not by this juſtifie the guilty betrayer and condemn the innocent betrayed one? How well may the paſſers by (as ye ſay) clap their hands and wag their heads, and ſay is this a Church that men call an aſſembly of <hi>Zion?</hi> And are theſe your gathered Churches, about which there hath been ſo much contending? Truly the very heathen amongſt you may eaſily diſcern you, as far from an aſſembly of <hi>Zion</hi> as is betwixt <hi>Zion</hi> and <hi>Aegypt.</hi> And how much more ſeen and known are ye by the Children of Light, who never can believe your ſelf ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to be the way of God, nor the Separated Congregations (as ye call them) the Churches of Chriſt, but the harlot, whileſt they are only in the outward Separation, &amp; not ſeparated within the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious from the vile, and from that which makes a ſeparation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and them, living in pride and high mindedneſſe, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and embracing untruth, and rejecting and not cloſing with truth, but give head to lying ſpirits, to which with the reſt of the World, the heathen who know not God ye are ſubject. Ye ſeem offended that I ſtile you <hi>the mingled people and call you the Independent Baptized,</hi> &amp;c. To which I ſay, I ſtiled you as ye were, and if ye count it a reproach to be termed ſo, is it not a greater reproach to be ſo?

Chriſt was Baptized of <hi>John,</hi> and ſo it became them to fulfiill all righteouſneſſe. I ſay to fulfill it, and did he by that leave it a ſtanding ordinance of the New Teſtament to all Generations? &amp;c.

And <hi>Paul</hi> who was a Miniſter of the new Teſtament made after the death of the Teſtator when the new Teſtament was in force, ſaid, <hi>Chriſt ſent me not to baptize, but to preach the Goſpel, &amp;c.</hi>

And if it be the light as ye grant it is that convinceth of the need of your water Baptiſm, how comes it to paſs, ye were once ſo near caſting out of <hi>Hannah Taylor</hi> (as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid) for embracing it; and what great glory is it, that but one of your Baptiſts are convinced of truth, and turned from darkneſs to the light? &amp;c.

And what advantage was it to the prieſts and their genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, when Chriſt came a light into the world, that but few of them believed in the truth, and were obedient to that which the world with themſelves oppoſed, and ſaid it was the Devil?

            <p>Ye ſay, <hi>Hath not Chriſt called and owned you his Church, and that I can teſtify ye were at firſt rightly conſtituted, and have profeſt that Chriſt hath manifeſted his preſence amongſt you? &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I ſay. That ever Chriſt called ſuch a ſurfeited bodie as yours a Church of his, is denyed, and teſtimonie is born againſt
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62941:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>it. But that his preſence was amongſt you, and manifeſted to many, who by the power of it are drawn and ſeparated from amongſt you is granted, though ye have neither known nor received him, but caſt him off, and were not obedient, but have rebelled and vexed his ſpirit, ſo that by the weapons of his power is he fighting againſt you, with whom it is but the beginning of ſorrowes, and if ye turn not, he is whetting his glittering ſword, and his hand takes hold of vengeance, &amp;c. And if, as ye ſay, <hi>ye were at firſt rightly conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> then are ye your ſelves (not I nor others with me) Apoſtates and backſlidden from that in which at firſt ye were gathered: For then ye did diſown thoſe called Anabaptiſts and their practices, in which ye were ſo zealous, that ye did often admoniſh and reprove, and were near the caſting out <hi>Hanna Taylor</hi> (as I have ſaid) now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Hanna Packer,</hi> becauſe ſhe owned it; But now ye do own the Anabaptiſts and their practices, and ye your ſelves become Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers thereof, as ye confeſſe, and do admoniſh and reprove others, who in conſcience and obedience to the light of Chriſt, cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to your cuſtomes and traditions, but by his power reproves them, ſtanding in that, by which at firſt they were convinced, and gathered out of the world, and all its pollutions, ſo far as to them it was made manifeſt. And therefore all your feigned words of back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding and back-ſliders Apoſtatizing, and Apoſtates both in your title page, and other places in your book, is clearlie turned upon your ſelves, who are the Apoſtates and back-ſliders of which ye ſpeak, and to whom belong all the reproofes and admonitions ye pretend to others who are obedient to the light, by which the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of your will-worſhips and inventions is made manifeſt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, as was that of Pariſhes and other aſſemblies before: And as for the Churches of <hi>Galatia</hi> and <hi>Aſia;</hi> Alas! what have ye to do with them in whoſe life ye are not, and are ſhut and caſt out, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But ye who hate the light, and like the owles of the deſart, love to be in darkneſs, not in light, and therefore cover your ſelves with a veil, that with open face ye may not ſee the glorie of the Lord, ye are not able to judge or try as they did, and therefore in your darkened minds call light darkneſs, and darkneſs light, rejecting the corner ſtone, who is the head of the Church, ſpeaking reproachfully of perfection, and thoſe that attain it, when Chriſt commanded his to be perfect, as their heavenly father was perfect, and his Miniſters preſſed to the attainement of it.</p>

But I take notice, how unwilling the harlot is to confeſs her own guilt, and therefore ſaith, <hi>perhaps it was her ſin,</hi> which is but a deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſhift, from a juſt ſtroak for her hypocriſie; and if ye could ſpeak truth in this particular, ye might have told the world plainly, that whileſt I was amongſt you, ye had not whereof juſtly to accuſe me, of which I know I have a witneſs in your conſciences, ſo that moſt that then were of the company loved and prized me dearly, and many were ſorely grieved at my departure. But when nothing could prevail, becauſe into <hi>Aegypt</hi> again I could not go then and not before ſome <hi>Diotrepes,</hi> that loved preheminence, prating againſt the innocent with malicious words, by degrees made a partie, and deviſed thoſe pretended accuſations, and with much deceit, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivableneſs of unrighteouſneſs prevailed with you, to charge upon me, &amp;c. which if ye had clearly manifeſted and not drawn this fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther guilt of lying, &amp;c. upon your ſelves, ſome had been excuſable, but now ye muſt bear your ſhame and judgement whatſoever ye are.</p>
            <p>But now ye come to a fifth branch of that ye call <hi>an admonition,</hi> though in pag 13. where ye ſay ye inſert it <hi>verbatim,</hi> ye number but four, and that which here ye put as a fifth general branch, ye there make a fourth particular in the fourth general, and yet ye ſay its <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batim:</hi> But in this alſo, not onely your falſhood, but alſo your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion is ſo fully manifeſted, that I need ſay no more, but leave it to the Reader to judge.</p>
            <p>But ye ſay, <hi>It is for ſpeaking againſt the Scriptures, affirming they were blind, and a plague to ſouls, and that they are not the Word of God, nor rule of life, and this ye would have underſtood to be verbatim,</hi> though like the reſt, it will eaſily appear to be a parcel of falſhood, hypocriſie and deceit, for beſides your own confuſions before mentioned, in the

            </p>
            <p>Now let the Reader, whoſe eye is opened, judge how theſe agree, The perſon ſent to admoniſh at the ſame time or thereahouts, gives it under his hand, that what he writ out, and delivered to me, was a true Coppy of what he received. And the whole company, after they received an anſwer thereunto, deviſeth and publiſheth another, and ſay it is <hi>verbatim,</hi> though it much differs from the former: The latter ſaith, the charge there mentioned was <hi>verbatim,</hi> in theſe words, <hi>Speaking reproachfully of the bleſſed Scriptures, affirming they were blind, and a plague to ſouls,</hi> &amp;c. the former in theſe words, <hi>Speaking reproachfully of the precious Scripture of truth,</hi> as firſt affirming that it was a blind to ſouls, and aly. one of the greateſt plagues of the land; The one puts both together, <hi>The Scripture is blind and a plague,</hi> the other divides them into two particulars, and ſaith firſt, <hi>a blind to ſouls,</hi> and 2ly. <hi>one of the greateſt plagues of the Land;</hi> the one, that <hi>the Scriptures were blind,</hi> the other, <hi>that it is a blind,</hi> the one, that <hi>they were blind,</hi> and <hi>a plague to ſouls,</hi> and never mentions the <hi>Land;</hi> The other, that it is firſt, <hi>a blind to ſouls,</hi> and 2ly. <hi>a plague;</hi> yea, <hi>one of the greateſt plagues of the Land,</hi> and mentions not ſouls: The one ſaith, <hi>The pretious Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of truth,</hi> The other, <hi>the bleſſed Scriptures,</hi> and mentions not the words <hi>(of truth)</hi> And yet if any man is given over to believe lies, ye will perſwade him all this is true and <hi>verbatim,</hi> that is, word for word, according to the copy. And that (notwithſtanding this lying ſpirit, which is found in your mouths, to which ye give heed; ye are a Church of Chriſt, or a myſtical body (a word of deceit from the bottomleſſe pit) which may be ſubject to this ſpirit, as it plainly appears to all beholders, ye are by what your ſelves have publiſhed. And truly the day hath manifeſted you very much, and ye cannot be hid but by the light your deeds of darkneſſe are and will be reproved, and your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended admonition farther manifeſted to be but ſtudied accuſations, <hi>and from your father the devil, who was a liar from the beginning, and abode not in the truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as that which ye call your admonition, and ſay ye did inſert <hi>verbatim</hi> as a bundle of lies and confuſion as hath been manifeſted, ſo is that which ye call your proof; for in page 13. ye ſay <hi>becauſe I ſaid thoſe things (that is to ſay your charge) are ſtudied accuſations, and from the father of lies, &amp;c. ye ſhall therefore prove every tittle to be true.</hi> And in page 18. ye ſay <hi>ye have proved every tittle to be true and clear;</hi> and in page 26. your 3 Meſſengers who boaſt that they received their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from God to this work, ſay <hi>that the things that they charged me withall are all true in every ſillable of it, as doth appear by the foregoing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of the whole Church.</hi> Now then if ye have not proved every tittle of your charge to be true, and if it do not appear by your foregoing
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62941:16"/>anſwer, that every ſillable of that with which your Meſſengers charged me is true, then are ye proved (both thoſe that did ſend, and thoſe that were ſent) no Church of Chriſt, but a company of lyars and falſe aſſerters. But ye have not proved every title, and every ſilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thereof to be true, and therefore are ye no Church of Chriſt, but a company of lyars, for firſt ye charged me for leaving the Church, and now ye ſay, that I have left the Church is true, but no proof thereof have ye given, neither is it true which ye ſay, for the Church I have not left, but to witneſs the Church I have left the harlot, and that I have abſolutely forſaken, left and renounced fellowſhip with you in all your idolatrous heatheniſh wayes and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips which ſtand in the will and time of man, and not in the will and power of God; and by the mighty arm and power of the Lord am I ſeparated from amongſt you, never again to have fellowſhip, nor communion with you, in thoſe unfruitful works of darkneſs, which by the light are reproved, is granted, elſe could I never know nor witneſs the Church of Chriſt which is in God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: But that ye are the Church of Chriſt is denyed and was deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and by your fruits, and what lodged in you were ye proved an harlot, a ſynagogue of Satan, &amp;c. which ſtands vvholly unanſvvered by you. And therefore it is not true, but a lie, to ſay I left the Church, when I was ſeparated from the Harlot, that I might witneſs the Church. But ſuppoſe it had been true, that I had left the Church, by vvhat have ye proved it? Why onely your ſelves ſay it is ſo, but that is no proof, and yet this is more than tittles and ſyllables, it is vvhole ſentences, ye a general charge not proved, except vvhat the harlot ſpeaks (to ſave her head, vvhen to judgement ſhe is brought) is to be believed and admitted as a proof.</p>
            <p>But ye go on and ſay, <hi>that my ſo doing hath drawn away ſome, grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved others, and opened the mouehs of many to ſpeak evil of the wayes of Chriſt which is clear, and plain, and not a ſtudied accuſation, but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al thing, which hath been grief, and ſadneſs to the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I reply if the Harlot or Synagogue of Satan, might be believed in her own caſe, when ſhe ſpeaks not truth, then what ye ſay were of ſome value. But from the Church have I drawn none, nor been a grief, nor ſadneſs (that I know) to her, with whom in ſome meaſure I have unity. Neither do I know of any whoſe mouths I have juſtly opened, to ſpeak evil! of the wayes of Chriſt which are pure and ſpiritual; So that the whoriſh and adulterous harlot cannot ſee it, who is grieved and ſadned at my departure, whoſe judgement is come and her torments from the living God are pouring, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath ſhe opened her mouth very wide, and from her unclean fountain and ſpirit of envie is pouring out of ſtoods of reviling &amp; bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes, not onely when ſhe aſſembles in her harlots houſes, and Idol Temples with the reſt of the proud and perſecuting World, where the Churches of Chriſt after they were gathered did never aſſemble, but in her books and pamphlets ſpeaking evil as ſhe can, not only of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62941:16"/>the Church &amp; ways of Chriſt, which ſhe underſtands not, but of Chriſt Jeſus himſelf who is come a light into the World, ane is the light of the World, which hath enlightned every man that cometh into the World, and this is clear and plain, and no ſtudied accuſation, but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al thing and her proper ſentence juſtly due is gone forth from the preſence of the Lord, and over her head doth ſtand.</p>
            <p>And notvvithſtanding ye ſay, <hi>I</hi> gave no vvord or reaſon of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, the ſober Chriſtian ye mention will eaſily perceive that this is another refuge of lies, for it was reaſon enough of my departure, to deny you to be a Church of Chriſt, and to prove you an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, a Synagogue of Satan, a cage &amp;c. And all this I have done not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ye bluſh not to ſay I gave no reaſon of my departure, &amp;c. But <hi>I</hi> perceive that which troubles you is that I who ſo well knew you, and was ſo long as an Elder amongſt you; whom ye did ſo often chuſe and elect to that employment; and ſo highly eſteemed, ſhould now ſo ſadly apoſtatize (as ye call it) as not to acknowledge you a Church.</p>
            <p>To which I reply, Were ye indeed a Church of Chriſt, how glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would I acknowledge ye? But till ye prove your ſelves ſo, I may (in the words of <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> to <hi>Ralph Farmer,</hi> in the 60 page of your book) tell you, <hi>though you be ſo wiſe to propoſe, I cannot be ſo fooliſh as to grant it, leſt I make my ſelfe a tranſgreſſor like unto you, and rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the light, which hath manifeſted you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now let me demand your proof; for although ye ſay, <hi>ye would prove every tittle, and had proved every tittle of what ye charged me withal,</hi> yet is here no proof at all produced to prove that I drew any from the Church, grieved and ſadned many, or opened the mouths of any, to ſpeak evill of the wayes of Chriſt, yet is this more than a tittle or a ſyllable, it is many words and ſentences.</p>
            <p>Oh fooliſh people and unwiſe! how hath the Devill, the god of the world, and Rulers of the darkneſſe blinded you? why, is there no feare of God before your eyes? who are adding one iniquity to another, as drunkenneſſe to thirſt, and yet beſpeak your ſelves a Church. And becauſe ye have recovered a veile, with which your ſelves are blinded, do think all others muſt be veiled too; but where Chriſt is witneſſed, the veile is removed, and in the light of Chriſt, which ye have deſpiſed, and ſet at nought, are ye ſeen and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and your hypocriſies, inventions and traditions, will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, carnall ordinances, together with that lying ſpirit, to which ye give heed, are in the ſame light judged, denyed, and witneſſed againſt as that which to the Lord is abominable, and burthenſome, in which he hath no delight, but his ſoule hates becauſe it is iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and a loathſome thing (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.16.)</p>
            <p>But from you whom have I drawn away? Why had ye not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned one that ſome colour of truth might appear? or that by it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ye might be reproved, who of the ſtrong and mighty arme and power of the Lord are ignorant, by which he hath powerfully drawn
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62941:17"/>and gathered many from amongſt you (as well as from others who in the like deceit, are worſhipping they know not what) into his moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of holineſſe, which he in this his day is ſetting up, and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over your heads, and a top of all mountains, in which to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the Lord is making a feaſt of fat things, of which thoſe that pour out a drink offering to that number, muſt not eat; in which moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Veile is removed, the ſhadows taken away, no Lyon or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall devouring beaſtly thing can ever come; but in it is the way of holineſſe known and witneſſed, and life, light and immortality reigns for evermore, and the true and living God, in ſpirit, life and power, known and worſhipped, who is light, and in whom there is no dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe at all. And ſo, although groſs darkneſſe hath overſpread the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> land, where the Diviners, the Sorcerers, the Taskmaſters and oppreſſors dwell, yet in <hi>Jacobs</hi> Tent there is light, by which the deeds of darkneſſe are ſeen and reproved: And therefore although ye have taken liberty to vent your lies and ſlaunders, and falſe accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations againſt the innocent, over your high places, when ye aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by troops in harlots houſes, where the children of light dare not come to reproove and gainſay it, except they are thereunto power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully moved of the Lord, to teſtifie againſt your deceipt and abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination: Yet muſt ye learn wiſdome, and take heed of printing and publiſhing ſuch ſtuffe to the world, elſe may ye be ſure, whilſt ye ſeek to cover it with a veile, your iniquities will be marked, your filthy ſepulchre opened (which is already but badly painted) your skirts more diſcovered, ſo that ſhame and confuſion will be your por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for evermore, except ye repent: And therefore of this be ye warned.</p>
            <p>In your third branch ye lay the charge thus, viz. <hi>your extream cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoriouſneſſe, and raſh judging, not onely of perſons abroad, but alſo of the Church,</hi> &amp;c. And tell the world ye will prove (yea that ye have proved) every tittle and ſyllable of theſe things to be true, when ye have not endeavoured ſo much as a ſhew of proof for ought ye ſpeak touching perſons abroad, but paſt it over as if ye had never ſpoken it: And yet this is tittles and ſyllables, yea words, &amp;c. But a bridle for your tongue ye want, who have ſo long given heed to lying ſpirits, that now ye appear to love lying, more then to ſpeak truth, and (being out of the fear of the Lord) ſpeak ye care not what.</p>
            <p>I come now to your fifth branch, and ſhall not trouble my ſelfe again with thoſe many lies, falſhoods, and contradictions which I there finde in what you ſay is <hi>verbatim,</hi> having mentioned ſome of them before, but ſhall examine your proof of that alſo, and ſee if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very tittle of it be proved, or whether ye may not be proved lyars in this, as in the reſt.</p>
            <p>Ye ſay, <hi>I did at a meeting at mine houſe affirme the firſt part of this branch,</hi> viz. <hi>That the Scriptures were blinde, and a plague to ſouls:</hi> And for proof, ye again produce your own ſaying, <hi>it is ſo,</hi> and that ſome of you ſitting over againſt me, do well remember how I ſpake it,

               <hi>Clapping my hand upon the book or table,</hi> ſaying, <hi>That Book or Scriptures was one of the greateſt blindes and plagues to mens ſouls this day in England. And that ye will again affirme, and ſet your hands to it that I ſpake thoſe very words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I ſay, There was a time in which many falſe witneſſes were brought againſt him who was the truth and the light, but they agreed not. And when by the truth ye are examined, it will be found, that ye alſo are far from agreeing in teſtimony; for proving what your ſelves affirme, if your own teſtimony were admitted in your own caſe, which it is not. Ye ſay, <hi>ye will again affirme, and ſet your hands to it, that I ſpake thoſe very words.</hi> And what words are they? Not the ſame in the charge, which ye ſay is <hi>verbatim,</hi> but is much otherwiſe, and ſo the charge is fall'n and falſe, as the Reader may ſee: And who are they that will affirme and ſet their hands to it? Are they the whole company, or but a part? If it be the whole, then many or moſt of you will affirme and ſet your hands to that which themſelves have confeſt they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard: If it be but a part, and not the whole, then that which yee have already ſaid, is altogether falſe, and untrue, and your teſtimony invalid: For what is ſaid, is ſaid by the whole, or elſe thoſe that ſigned it, are in this, as in other things, abhominable lyars.</p>
            <p>Again, in what ye ſay ye will affirme, and ſet your hands unto, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears much uncertainty; for ye ſay, <hi>I clapt my hand on the book or table,</hi> but on which I perceive ye are ignorant: And ye ſay <hi>I ſaid that booke or Scripture.</hi> Now if ye ſo well remember the manner of ſpeech, as ye ſay ye doe, it is much ye cannot remember the matter. But having before accuſed me for ſaying <hi>the Scriptures were a blinde to ſoules, and a plague to the Land.</hi> Now ye ſay, <hi>It was, the booke or Scriptures that I ſaid was one of the greateſt blindes and plagues to mens ſoules this day in</hi> England. Manifeſting your ſelves to be at a loſſe and in confuſion, not able to ſay, whether it were the Book or the Scriptures, or what it was, for indeed it was neither: And ſo the charge or accuſation is quite fallen, and by your ſelves brought to nought.</p>
            <p>And why are theſe words, viz. <hi>one of the greateſt plagues,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in England,</hi> now added? being left out in the place where ye ſay ye did inſert <hi>verbatim:</hi> Is here no deſigned ſubtilty and deceipt? Is all proved? Are here no tittles, nor ſyllables neglected in the proof? Or is what ye have publiſhed like to be true, or fit to be believed? Let the Reader conſider it.</p>
            <p>But ye ſay, <hi>ſome of you</hi> ſitting over againſt me (it's like, at the Table) do well remember, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But why had ye not told me, who theſe <hi>ſome</hi> were that ſate over againſt me, and do remember it? For I know but four that were wont to ſit with me at the Table, and with three of them have I ſpoken, neither of which could to my face ſay or affirme, they ever heard me ſpeak ſuch things, and then the <hi>ſome</hi> is but one, and that is an <hi>hireling</hi> too, a Diviner, a deceitful worker, that daubeth with untempered morter, and cries peace, peace, to that to which the Lord ſpeaks no peace, and his teſtimony is little worth; for if ye ſay he ſate over againſt me at the Table, when I ſpake ſuch words, <hi>Jane Frye</hi> contradicts him, who is the only perſon beſides himſelf, that ever I heard, or could learn, had the ſhameleſſe confidence to ſay, ſhe heard me ſpeak theſe things, with whom I had conference in the preſence of other witneſſe, and demanded where it was ſpoke, ſhe replyed, <hi>in mine owne houſe at a meeting;</hi> I cold her it
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62941:18"/>was much many others heard it not as well as ſhe. To which ſhe replyed, <hi>it was after the meeting was done, and I was riſen from the Table, and ſtood out in the roome, and there clapt my hand on the Booke, and ſpake as before.</hi> And that her ſelfe, with her ſiſter <hi>Haſſard,</hi> and her ſiſter <hi>Anne Davis,</hi> went out into the ſtreets, and bewailed it; which I knowing not to be true, ſent to <hi>Anne Davis</hi> to enquire the truth of it, by a relation of hers, who anſwered, that ſhe never heard me ſpeak ſuch words, nor any thing like it: So that it is evident, falſe witneſſe do not agree; for ye ſay, ſome of you ſitting over againſt me, which muſt needs be at the Table, upon which, or upon the book, ye ſay, I clapt my hand, when I ſpake. But ſhe ſaith, <hi>it was after the meeting was done, and I was gone from the Table,</hi> in which is no agreement. She ſaid, <hi>Anne Davis</hi> with her ſelfe and another went into the ſtreets and bewailed it: but <hi>Anne Davis</hi> denies that ever ſhe heard it. She ſaid, <hi>ſtanding out in the room, I clapt my hand upon the booke, and ſaid, the Scriptures were a plague,</hi> &amp;c. But ye ſay, <hi>I clapt my hand upon the book or table, and ſaid, the book or Scriptures were blinde and a plague;</hi> but cannot agree whether it was a Book or a Table, a book or Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: And ſo are all in confuſion, being led by a lying ſpirit, and able by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement to prove nothing. Beſides ye ſay, <hi>the book or Scriptures,</hi> but in the copy delivered to me, it was ſaid <hi>the Scriptures of truth,</hi> in which is no agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Beſides all this, one of you being asked, if ever he heard me ſpeak thoſe words, anſwered, that hee heard me ſpeak to this effect, <hi>That the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, as men goe to worke with it, making it a pattern of all manner of vice and wickedneſſe, was one of the greateſt plagues,</hi> &amp;c. And being demanded then, why ye had not laid the charge in the very words that were ſpoken, he was ſilent as to that, and ſaid, <hi>he had already purchaſed jealouſie from ſome in the Church, as one that was in danger,</hi> &amp;c. And this I have under the hand of him to whom it was ſpoken.</p>
            <p>Now let all, to whom true judgement is known, judge what differing teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie here is, and how like it appears to that of old, in which no agreement could be againſt the innocent: And how deſperately-wicked ye appear under a cloak of Religion, accuſing for ſomething, but cannot manifeſt for what, but in it contradict your ſelves: And in ſome things <hi>Jane Frye</hi> is nearer the matter than the other 59. or thereabouts who falſe witneſſes are found; becauſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a meeting was ended, in which <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> had been ſpeaking about that Idol called <hi>Divinity,</hi> and the people moſtly gone, and I roſe from the Table, and ſtanding neer the middle of the room, did there ſay, and declare, <hi>that that accurſed thing called the body of Divinity was a plague to the land,</hi> or words to that effect, of which I told you before, though ye wickedly ſhut your eyes, and not obſerved it becauſe it was the truth. And were it not ſo, it had been one with that ſpirit to which ye have taken heed.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe credit vvere to be given to ſuch a generation, vvho in teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny do not agree, but are proved as before, &amp;c. yet to the Reader vvould I ſay, vvhat probability of truth can be in vvhat they ſay I affirmed, <hi>viz. That the Scriptures of truth were one of the greateſt blindes and plagues to mens ſoules this day in England,</hi> as if truth could be a blinde and a plague to ſoules, vvhen it is a lying ſpirit is ſo to yours. And notvvithſtanding I never made a trade of the Scriptures, <hi>nor preach't for hire, nor divined for money</hi> (as others do) <hi>nor ever co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62941:18"/>any mans gold or ſilver, or apparel</hi> amongſt you, nor accepted thereof, vvhen by ſome I was earneſtly preſt thereunto; but on the contrary have admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred ſomething largely of theſe things amongſt you. Yet from the Scriptures did I daily diſcourſe, as opportunity I had; and by it have convinced many amongſt you, of your pride, formality, and other evils; ſo that once ye were very much awakened, and brought to ſome ſenſe of your condition, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ye had been too much taken with the doctrine of ſome called <hi>Notioniſts,</hi> which it may be, is the ſame ye now call <hi>Ranters,</hi> whoſe principles and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, by the Scriptures, I did withſtand and oppoſe, and with much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and ſore wreſtlings was I inſtrumental to deliver you out of their mouths, to whom many of you were become a prey; I ſay, much awakened ye were, and the ſpirit which convinceth of ſin, began to work, until ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Miniſtry of unrighteouſneſs came, which, for the wages of iniquity, taught you to erre, and (when ye were convinced of ſin, and troubled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and ſaw your filth and wickedneſs appear; by which your peace was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and your conſciences awakened, and true judgement took hold on the tranſgreſſor) preſt you to believe lyes, and ſhut out that which troubled, and ſaid it was temptations of the Devil, and that your ſin was done away, and that God ſaw it not, that it was all pardoned, daubing with untempered mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, crying peace, peace, to that to which no peace is ſpoken from God, by which your bonds were made ſtrong, and the hands of evil doers ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they turned not, nor repented, which wicked doctrine of the Devil, by the Scripture I oppoſed, and withſtood, perſwading you to the laſt, not to build on the ſand, but come down to the rock; and told you, your peace was but ſecurity, which the Devils goods may attain, and that all your aſſurance, in which ye gloried, was but vain confidence, which in the time of tryal would deceive you; and ſo far did I diſpute it with you, dailie, by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that <hi>Thomas Ewins,</hi> your publique Preacher told me, I daſht his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and weakened his hands, ſo that he was not able to preach, but when into the Pulpit he was to go, fear and trembling ſometimes took hold upon him, ſo that if neceſſity had not been upon him to ſpeak, the people being aſſembled, he ſhould not have ſpoken a word, and told me of retiring to his former Calling, and leaving the City, with much more. Others who loved to have ſmooth things ſpoken, that they might be at eaſe in <hi>Zion,</hi> who put far away the evil day, complained (as he ſaid) that all the comforts and joy they received and gathered from his Miniſtry all the day, was daſht and broken by me in the evening. Others complaining, at laſt confeſt I led you ſafely, though not comfortably; and all was, becauſe the Devils Kingdom was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed, and his goods not ſuffered to be at peace; and in your conſciences do you know, that by the Scriptures I demonſtrated what I ſaid; to which I was as true as any amongſt you whatſoever. And if in this ye ſhall ſay I boaſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member its you that have compelled me, and if ye have a mind to gain-ſay or contradict any particular of it, do it honeſtly, plainly, and down-rightly, not coverty and deceitfullie as ye have done before, that when I come to reply, I may have ſomething like as from men, to ſpeak unto, and not as from a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of fooliſh toſt children. For although to this was I was at firſt averſe, yet by the power and preſence of the living God, ſhall I be free and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to quench your thorns, ſcatter your deceit, and remove your veil, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Harlots skirts.</p>
            <pb n="34" facs="tcp:62941:19"/>
            <p>But friends, ſuppoſe all ye ſay were granted, and that I had indeed, whilſt I was amongſt you entertained, and aſſerted many principles contrary to truth, and ſaid, <hi>that the Scriptures of truth were a blinde to ſouls, and one of the greateſt plagues of the land,</hi> (which I have, and utterly do deny,) And ſuppoſe it were granted an error, and a very great ſin ſo to ſay and affirm, yet was not all this done in your meeting, whilſt I was one and amongſt you? and not then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved nor gain ſayed. And was it not then time for all that feared the Lord, and loved the truth to depart out of ſuch an Aſſembly, in which ſuch things are permitted to be entertained and publiſhed without rebuke? Was there any ſafety in being one with ſuch an Harlot, though ſhe call her ſelf a Church? And are not theſe things ſpots, whilſt <hi>the true Church of Chriſt, which is his glorious body, is without ſpot or wrinckle?</hi> Surely, little cauſe have any who know the truth, and love and believe in the light, to be grieved or ſad'ned, that any be drawn from ſuch an Aſſembly; and happy for me was the day, in which the light manifeſted you, and from amongſt you ſeparated me, to another people, where no ſuch principles are entertained, nor permitted to be ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And for mine own part, I do freely declare to all the world, that ſince, by the power of the good ſhepherd, I was gathered from amongſt you, I am fan from entertaining or uttering any ſuch things: but do dearly own the Scriptures of truth, as given by inſpiration, and ſee them of great uſe and ſervice. And if I received and entertained ſuch principles, contrary to truth amongſt you, with you I alſo left them, to whom the Scripture is of little uſe, more then to talk of, and trade with for an advantage; and by wreſting and corrupting the ſame, make uſe of it as a veil to cover your deceipt and filthineſs, but the life thereof do not witneſs.</p>
            <p>But I have not yet done with your teſtimony, in pag. 13. where ye ſay, <hi>ye inſert your admonition verbatim.</hi> Ye charge me with aſſerting in the Church, doctrines contrary to truth, one of which is, that the Scriptures are not the Word of God, and every tittle of this, ye ſay ye have proved; notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, ye have not proved any thing of it to be true, but only ask if I did not at a meeting at the <hi>Red-lodge</hi> in the Garden-houſe, before near twenty people ſay ſo? one of you being by, &amp;c. Truly the Harlots fore-head is very hard, if at this ſhe do not bluſh: What! Lay a general charge, and ſay ye will prove, and have proved every tittle, and yet can ſay nothing, but ask me if it were not ſo. And in pag 12. &amp; 13. ye lay <hi>this thing to be aſſerted in the Church, and ſay ye will prove every tittle,</hi> and now ask me if I did not ſpeak it at the <hi>Red-lodge</hi> in the Garden-houſe, which was at a meeting of thoſe ye call miſerable delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded people, who are wandring as ye ſay, in the dark. At which time ſay ye; one of us was by. So then, by your own confeſſion, either thoſe ye call mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable deluded people, who are wandring in the dark, muſt be the Church, or elſe ye a company of lyars. And let me tell you, theſe things are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aequivocations and mental reſervations, of which ye ſpeak, but down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right lying and deceit. And becauſe I asked where the Scripture called it ſelf the Word of God, ye ſay, <hi>for anſwer, ye ſhall give me four plain places in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of many;</hi> three of which places have not theſe expreſſions in them, <hi>viz. the Word of God,</hi> much leſs that the Scriptures calls it ſelf ſo; and the fourth place ſaith, <hi>for laying aſide the commandements of God, ye hold the traditions of men, and full well ye reject the commandement of God,</hi> that ye <hi>may keep your own tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions;</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:62941:19"/>and again, <hi>making the Word of God of none effect thorough your traditions.</hi> Now although in this Scripture, the Word of God is mentioned, yet doth the Scripture therefore call it ſelf the Word of God? Or rather do not ye manifeſt your ſelves to be <hi>thoſe that do erre, not knowing the Scriptures nor the Word of God,</hi> which was before the Scripture was written, and from which the Scriptures were given forth, who through your own traditions, and the traditions of other men, do go about <hi>to make the</hi> powerful <hi>Word of God</hi> (by which all things were made, and forever are upheld) <hi>of none effect.</hi> And therefore ye ſay, <hi>what ſhall we go to light a candle to the Sun? Have not many judicious and godly Writers proved that the Scriptures are the Word of God?</hi> To which I reply, Many men have both ſaid and written it, from whoſe traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not from the Scriptures, ye have received it; and amongſt others, thoſe ye call Popes, Papiſts, Prieſts and Jeſuits as well as other ignorant and unlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, who wreſt the Scriptures as ye do, have aſſerted, and do affirm it, and in their printed books called Catechiſms, and Chriſtian doctrine, have laid it down as principles and fundamentals (as they as well as you call it) to be learned of all good Chriſtians; in which ye may find alſo the ground of your word, myſtical body, Sacraments, and ſome of that ye call inſtitutions, and moſt, if not all, your invented and carnal obſervations uſed in and about the worſhip of your God, for which no ground being in the Scripture, ye and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have by tradition received it from the Popes, Cardinals and Prieſts, and other Heathens that know not God. But thoſe that knew and miniſtred of the Word of God, which was not <hi>a dead letter,</hi> but quick and powerful, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that men ſhould not ſay, <hi>Who ſhall aſcend into heaven to fetch Chriſt from above, &amp;c. for the word of faith, which they preached, was nigh even in the mouth, and in the heart.</hi> And this is that which againſt your ſelves ye have rejected that ye may hold your own and other mens traditions, received as aforeſaid, and ſo do bear the character of thoſe wicked men, of which ye ſpeak, <hi>that caſt the Word of God behind their backs,</hi> who hate to be reformed thereby.</p>
            <p>And ſo having in your blind minds, without the fear of God, rambled tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough what ye had to ſay, in pretence of proof of that ye call your admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which indeed is but ſtudied accuſations, and from the father of lyes, and invented by his inſtruments amongſt you, as before I ſaid, In the cloſe ye ſay, <hi>Ye have proved every tittle to be true and clear, ſo that ye are no lyars nor falſe accuſers, but muſt turn that back again upon me, profeſſing to all the world I have wronged you in what I have written.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I reply, I wiſh ye had been found innocent before the Lord, and both true, and clear, and no lyars nor falſe accuſers, then I needed not ſo to have ſpoken; but inſtead thereof, ye are found more and more guilty, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding iniquity to iniquity; ſo that were it needful, I could reckon up many more of the lies, ſlanders, and falſe accuſations, of which ye ſtand guilty: To cloſe this particular, for I profeſs to all the world, ye are become ſuch a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue, and Cage of falſe, lying, and deceitful ſpirits, that to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, I never met with the like, nor did believe was to be found upon the earth, under the title of a ſeparated Congregation, of whom the Pariſh Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies may ſay (as ye ſay they will) they were better to remain as they are, then come amongſt you, except they intend to be made, <hi>twofold more the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of hell then they are already;</hi> for inſtead of proving your ſelves no lyars
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62941:20"/>nor falſe accuſers, and the things ye charged me withal to be true and clear; how clearly and truly are ye proved (yea have proved your ſelves) by many degrees, greater lyars then before; ſo that what is juſtly charged upon you, and ſaid of you, in <hi>the skirts of the whore,</hi> ſtands over your heads, in that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and power of truth, that ye ſhall never be able to return it back, nor free your ſelves of it, for it is your portion, and ye muſt bear it; and labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to acquit your ſelves, being guiltie, ye have brought upon your head, much more of the ſame righteous judgement, ſo that, notwithſtanding all your conſultations with all thoſe lying ſpirits, to which ye have given heed, for whoſe entertainment in your myſtical windie humour'd bodie ye plead, the better to recover your veil, and hide your ſhame, yet is your vail removed, your coveting ript off, and your ſhame manifeſted more then before, and your ſelves in your imaginations confounded, which from God is the portion of thoſe that hate the light, and bring not their deeds thereto.</p>
            <p>In pages, 18, 19. I find a parcel of deceitful ſtuff, ſcarce worth anſwering, yet can hardlie let paſs ſomething without rebuke; I find you <hi>blaming me for flattering and commending my ſelf, as ye ſay, when your ſelves have publiſhed a whole book, moſtly to vindicate, flatter and commend your ſelves, and one anothor in your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil wayes, till your iniquity is found out to be abhorred:</hi> Why had ye not caſt the beam out of your own eyes, before ye had meddled with motes in mine, and better conſidered the Scripture ye mention, <hi>viz Let another man praiſe thee, and not thy own lips.</hi> Again ye ſay, <hi>Amaziah was not blamed for the good he did, but becauſe he did it not with a perfect heart,</hi> &amp; yet your ſelves ſpeak contemptuouſly of perfection, and thoſe that labour to attain it. Ye ſay, <hi>ye knew my ſpirit, and what I did pretend to, and obſerved my groſs miſtake, but were not willing to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend me,</hi> &amp;c. which is deceit and hypocriſie, for the true Church <hi>cannot bear them that are evil,</hi> but teſtifies againſt them. And whereas I had ſaid, the knowledge ye had of Chriſt, ſhall profit you nothing, and that your habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was in deceipt, and thorough deceit ye refuſe to know the Lord, &amp;c. Ye ſay, in this thing <hi>ye did not violently oppoſe;</hi> and then its like ye confeſs it, as knowing it was the truth, and why then had ye not repented. Ye ſay, <hi>ſome of you did often tell me, that your comforts ſtood not ſo much in a knowing, as in an acknowledgement of Chriſt to be, that which he is ſaid to be in the Scriptures, and that ye own no other knowing of Chriſt, then underſtandingly to know him in his perſon without you.</hi> &amp;c. which is the ſum of moſt of the 19. page. And ſo have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, and clearly manifeſted the ground and foundation of all your Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, comforts, joy and peace, to be one and the ſame with the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Religion of the Pope, Jeſuits, drunkards, ſwearers, prophane, ignorant and ſuperſtitious people of the world, namely, an acknowledgement of Chriſt without you, to be that which he is ſaid to be in the Scriptures: And ſo the devils in this particular excel you, who did not only acknowledge him, but knew him, who he was, <hi>Jeſus the Son of God.</hi> And (concerning the Miniſters of Chriſt, which thoſe of your literal profeſſion, oppoſed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted) cryed out, <hi>theſe are the ſervants of the moſt high God.</hi> But the comfort, joy and peace of the children of light, ſtands not in your ground of general acknowledgement of Chriſt without them, to be what the Scriptures de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare him to be, but in a particular knowledge of him, as by the ſpirit of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs he is revealed within them, whereby they come to witneſs him the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62941:20"/>Son of God, with power by the reſurrection from the dead; and ſo <hi>Paul</hi> knew him, <hi>and ſo to know him, was, and is eternal life,</hi> and witneſſed ſo to be, by thoſe to whom he is ſo revealed: But this is a myſterie, hid and unknown to all that lie in the death, and never come to witneſs the firſt reſurrection, but declare the ground of their comforts to ſtand in that in which the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the world, with them are one. And this is not to ſlight and nullifie that glorious perſon in heaven, as ye falſelie ſay many of our way do, ſcoffing and jeering at you, for ſpeaking of the perſon of Chriſt, and thinking to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the blood of him that dyed at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which is but your falſe accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations and ſlanders, and proceeds from the ſame fountain and ſpirit of envy and wickedneſs, as <hi>Ralph Farmers</hi> bundles of lies did, in which he and ye are one, and at an agreement for ſcoffing and jeering, lying, and falſe accuſing, being the works of darkneſs, in which your generation are exerciſed, is deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all that vvalk in the light, vvhich is our vvay, and the vvay everlaſting. But to declare againſt your follie, and your thinkings to be ſaved by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knovvledging of Chriſt vvithout ye (whilſt of him and his life, ye are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, living in wickedneſs, lying, hypocriſie and deceipt, hating the light, and erring from the right way) is no error, but love to your ſouls, who pretend honour to the perſon (but hate the light) of Chriſt, and know not his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which is <hi>the power of God,</hi> nor his way, which is <hi>everlaſting, and lives;</hi> nor his Ordinances which are living, ſpiritual and true, not traditional, invented, and carnal: The conſideration of which, together with the lying ſpirits, to which ye give heed, might juſtly cauſe you to mind whether ye are not thoſe that ſtumble at Chriſt the corner ſtone, and do cauſe others to ſtumble at him, who is now come, and witneſſed in life power and ſpirit; and living demonſtrations thereof are given and manifeſted in thouſands, who by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience have known and felt the dove-like ſpirit of Chriſt, of which ye ſpeak, though both to you and others, who live in envie, murthering the juſt, and betraying the innocent, pretending honour to the name, but hating the light, and perſecuting the power of Chriſt. This is hid, and ye ſay, <hi>ye will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if thoſe that owned and ſeem to honour the Scripture, in which <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote of Chriſt, did not believe, but crucified him, when in fleſh he was made manifeſt, no marvel then if ye do not believe, who call the verie words of Scripture (in which to you I ſpake, page 21. of my former book) ſtrange and unchriſtian expreſſions, ſurelie ye are ſtrangelie erred from the way of truth, and true wiſdom, who live in ſuch confuſion and deceit, one while calling the Scriptures the Word of God, and rule of life, when by wreſting it ye can ſerve your luſts; but when by it ye are reproved for your wickedneſs, then ye call it <hi>ſtrange and unchriſtian expreſſions,</hi> and ſay, <hi>The Lord rebuke your railing,</hi> as if the Scripture, which ye term the Word of God and Rule of life, were rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Prophets, and holy men of God, which gave it forth, were railers, becauſe it bears true teſtimonie againſt your wicked wayes, as well as others, for the words I mentioned are recorded, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.1, 2, &amp;c. and in ſome other Scriptures, as the Reader will perceive, that reads my former Book.</p>
            <p>But ye ſay, <hi>its eaſie to heap up good words right or wrong:</hi> Alas poor blind peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by what blind guides are ye led? Is it ſtrange and unchriſtian expreſſions,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62941:21"/>and yet good vvords? Are they good vvords, and yet vvrong? What exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confuſion are the children of darkneſſe brought into, in this day of the Lords povver, in vvhich light is riſen out of obſcuritie, and the Lords glory appeared, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In pag. 21. Ye <hi>ſay, Though ſome of our way have ſhouted, and cryed Hoſannah, holy, holy, King of Iſrael to</hi> James Nayler, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>To which I reply, When will ye be weary of lying and falſe accuſing, which is the work of the Devill; for none of our way ever ſo cried to any man: But that which is our way, is the truth, and the life, and is everlaſting, the light and life of men, from which whoſoever turns aſide, forſakes the right way, and turns to lying vanities, as ſome in this day of the Lords viſitation have done, who muſt bear their burthen. But ye are eaſily ſeen of what generation ye are, who watch for an occaſion to ſpeak evill of the way of Truth, and the Saints, and Children of light, who in the fear of the Lord do walk, and in his Councell abide, which to you is not known, who are glad with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by any means to ſpeak evill of the way of Truth, and the people, who (being gathered into it) are for its ſake become ſtrangers in the earth, and to their familiar friends, and aliens to their mothers ſons, as all their fathers were. But in this again are ye and <hi>Ralph Farmer</hi> one; and by one and the ſame ſpirit are ye guided, to whom it is known, that thoſe that cried as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, are not of our way, but denied and witneſſed againſt before ever they did thoſe actions. But if I ſhould go about to gather up the actions and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, contrary to truth, which I have known and heard paſſe from ſome of your vvay (which is a very broad way) how abominable filthy would it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. But I forbear, farther then it may be for your advantage. Yet let me aske, if none of your way which is the broad vvay, leading to deſtruction, did tell me it vvas the pride of <hi>Mordecais</hi> heart, that bovved not to <hi>Haman:</hi> And another, that the Rulers and Elders had ſinned, if they had not crucified, or put Chriſt to death, becauſe they judged him a blaſphemer. And another, that the Pope and Jeſuits do believe in Chriſt. But this I caſt not upon you, vvhom I knovv not particularly guilty; but that ye may ſee the unjuſtneſſe of your ovvn ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations, and that the guilty ones may ſee it and be aſhamed.</p>
            <p>Ye fall a vvondring at my ſhameleſneſſe, as ye call it, in mentioning, <hi>that ſome of you did beate in your meetings, like the enemies of Chriſt in the ſynagogues,</hi> And ſay, <hi>yee will declare to all the world the truth of this ſtory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To vvhich I ſay, if ye can at laſt declare truth, it's vvell, and fit ye had done it ſooner: But ye tell hovv Sathan hath raged at your vvomens praying, in vvhich its like ye miſtake, and that it vvas the vvitneſſe of God that ſtrives againſt your hypocriſie, as it did of old againſt your fathers, vvhen their vvaies vvere corrupt before the Lord: And vvoe unto you, vvhen it ſhall ſtrive no more.</p>
            <p>Ye ſay, <hi>Two wretched women came ruſhing into the roome, one of which had been an old Ranter, the other a late member of this Church.</hi> Whereas they had been one as much a member vvith you, as the other, and neither are Ranters, but in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berneſſe do vvalk, and ſo came into your meeting; and, as ye ſay, told you, <hi>the prayers of the wicked is an abhomination to the Lord:</hi> With vvhich you vvere diſturbed, and the Woman forced to give over.</p>
            <p>reply; Its like then there was power in what was ſpoken, and its mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62941:21"/>the very words of the Scripture are your diſturbance. And therefore, like the <hi>Gadarens</hi> who in this are your pattern, ye deſired as ye ſay, theſe diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to depart your room (as they did Chriſt to depart their Coaſts:) But when they departed not, ye exceeded your pattern, as ye your ſelves confeſs, and would have put them out (its like) by force, which ye ſay is all the beating and occaſion of it: Which is an abſolute lie, for down the ſtairs yee would have thrown them, as your fathers would have thrown Chriſt down the brow of the hill, which to do ye did attempt, haling, beating, and pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them till their bodies were ſore, in which your marks they did bear a long time after. So that here appears no truth nor ancient godlineſſe, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in them that did it, and this wickedneſſe do I not juſtifie, being condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the light, to which it is abhomination, and a more wicked thing than for two ſober women to come ſoberly into your meeting, and declare amongſt you the truth; whether ye hear or forbear.</p>
            <p>In page 23. ye endeavour the beſt you can to veile your ſelves from the ſtroak of truth, contained in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 83. and in the Propheſie of <hi>Obadiah.</hi> But all in vain, for it is your portion, and ye muſt bear it; from him who with righteouſneſſe doth judge the poor; and your demanding what groſſe darkneſs is upon my minde, that I ſhould be crying out againſt you that are innocent, will not veile you. Nay, notwithſtanding ye demand again, whether I be not joyned with all the Papiſts, Atheiſts, Ranters, and all the ungodly rabble of the world, in this one great deſigne of the Devil, to break in pieces the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Chriſt, &amp;c. And then mention under the name of Anabaptiſts, Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, Sectaries, Schiſmaticks, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, nay, with the Harlot I am not joyned, for then muſt I be one body with you. But from among you all am I ſeparated by the power of the Lord, to witneſſe his preſence, And therefore your ſelves, with all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, Atheiſts, Ranters, and ungodly rabble of the world, who in the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne of the Devill are joyned, to hate the light, and perſecute and oppoſe the life &amp; power of God, do I deny, and ſtand a witneſſe againſt. And although ye are the many-headed Beaſt in divers forms, ſects and opinions, under the name of Papiſts, Atheiſts, Independents, Anabaptiſts, &amp;c. and upon a like ground pretend to Chriſts perſon, Goſpel, and Ordinances, as before I ſaid, and with one mouth, and with one ſhoulder, cry out againſt, and oppoſe his light and living preſence, for which ye aſſociate and take counſell together of one and the ſame lying ſpirit, yet ye muſt be broken, and as a new threſhing inſtrument is the Lord making the worm <hi>Jacob,</hi> to threſh your mountains, as chaffe, and your little hills as duſt: And the day of your diſtreſſe and viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is begun, in which all that ſee you ſhall wag the head, who with the moſt embittered enemies are joyned againſt the light and life of God, and with Atheiſts, Drunkards, and prophane perſons, who live in ſcoffing, ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reproaching, and deriding, in ſlandering, falſhood and lies, do ye aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, teaching the wicked of the world your wayes, and the Children that have not underſtanding, to blaſpheme the light, and living way to the Father, which is your own returned.</p>
            <p>But can ye be honeſt and own what ye ſay, and novv flie from it? If ſo, then I demand, Is it indeed the great deſigne of the Devil, to break in pieces the Congregations in <hi>England,</hi> under the names of <hi>Independents, Anabaptiſts, Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:62941:22"/>&amp;c. as ye pretend it is? If nay, then are ye falſe and deceitfull in what ye have written: If yea, then is there a falſe Prophet, and Miniſter of Satan to be found amongſt you, in whoſe mouth he hath been a lying ſpirit, to which ye ought to give no longer heed. For <hi>Robert Purnell,</hi> in his book entitled, <hi>Good newes to ſinners, great joy to Saints,</hi> declares the contrary. And in pag. 65. undertakes to be a Prophet, and ſaith, <hi>a few words by way of propheſie of the downfall of Presbytery, Independency, Anabaptiſme, &amp;c.</hi> And then he calls upon all the ſervants of the moſt high and mighty God, heirs of promiſe, and ſons of Zion to look for great alterations and changes, and to ſee what deſolations God will make in the earth, and for nothing but the Lord to be revealed from heaven, which ſaith he will be mighty in his diſpenſations, exceeding glorious in his revelation, and ſtrong and powerfull in his operation, and will bring to paſſe his determinations, and deſtroy in this mountain the face of the cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caſt over all people, and the veile that is ſpread over all Nations; which veile he ſaith, is knowing Chriſt and Chriſtians after the fleſh, which <hi>Paul</hi> did not do, after his eyes were opened, &amp;c. And ſo he goes on to manifeſt how <hi>Presbyterians, Independents, Anabaptiſts,</hi> &amp;c. are all vailed with the ſame veile, And therefore ſaith he, what I ſay to one Sect, I ſay to all, ye ſhall ſpeedily receive a totall rout. <hi>Yee have gathered your ſelve together, but ye ſhall be ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yea yee ſhall be broken in pieces.</hi> Ye all have built your outward houſe of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall diſcipline upon the ſand, and it muſt fall, becauſe it is not grounded upon the Rock Chriſt. Ye have made your communion the ground of your union, and that muſt fall, becauſe it is not the Lords, but mans building: And himſelfe puts the queſtion how he knew <hi>Presbytery, Independency, Anabaptiſme,</hi> and the reſt of the Sects muſt down, and anſwers, if <hi>Abraham</hi> by faith did ſee the day of Chriſt coming in the fleſh many years before he came, why may not I (ſaith he) and others ſee the day of Chriſt coming in the ſpirit (to deſtroy all fleſhly forms) ſome few years before it be finiſhed: And again ſaith he, I have by faith ſeen all theſe opinions fall, and have heard from many others, that they have ſeen them fall alſo. Therefore that which I have heard and ſeen declare I unto you, <hi>that ye might have fellowſhip with the father and the ſon in the ſpirit;</hi> for then, ſaith he, and not till then ye will give over ſaying, as in effect ye do, <hi>I am of Paul, I am of Apollo.</hi> Then ye will not ſo much cry up the forme, but endeavour the power of godlineſſe. Theſe with many more, are his words, as the Reader may ſee in his foreſaid book.</p>
            <p>Now therefore, if it be true, that all theſe formes are fleſhly, and are not built upon the Rock Chriſt, but upon the ſand, are not the Lords, but mens building, and therefore muſt fall, and be broken to pieces, and ſcattered, and ſpeedily receive a totall rout. And that he by faith hath ſeen it all fall; and hath both heard and ſeen what he declared, that is to ſay, Chriſt Jeſus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſpirit to deſtroy them, that people might have fellowſhip with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son in the Spirit. Then are <hi>Robert Purnell</hi> and you found dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly in the ſteps and practice of your Fathers, the Scribes and Phariſees, who (when Chriſt came in the fleſh, according to the Prophecies that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) ſaid, <hi>It was the Devil a blaſphemer, a friend to publicans and ſinners,</hi> &amp;c. For ye, now that Chriſt in ſpirit, in life and power, is appeared, mighty in diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, glorious in revelation, and very ſtrong and powerfull in operation, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king great alterations, changes and deſolations in the earth, and revealing
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62941:22"/>himſelf from heaven, breaking down and ſcattering what he hath not built, nor gathered; deſtroying and breaking in pieces thoſe Forms and Sects of yours, which he ſaith are fleſhly, not built by the Lord but men; not upon the Rock, but upon the ſand, and ſpeedily receives a total rout, &amp;c. I ſay, ſince Chriſt is thus appeared againſt all thoſe Forms, that his people may have fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with the Father and the Son, in the ſpirit, and not cry up the Form, but endeavour to know the power of godlineſs, according to the very words himſelf hath ſaid; both <hi>Robert Purnel</hi> and you agree to call it the deſign of the Devil, asking if I be not joined with all the Papiſts, Atheiſts, Ranters, and ungodly rabble of the world, in this one great deſign of the Devil, to break in pieces the Churches of Chriſt? And ſay, hath it not been the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of one power after another, to rent, break, and ſcatter the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in <hi>England,</hi> under the names of Independents, Anabaptiſts, Sectaries, &amp;c? And hath any party gone ſo far in this wicked practice as you, &amp;c? Nay, ſay you, was there ever any partie in <hi>England,</hi> or the Nations adjacent, that have offered the like violence to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, his perſon, in his Word, in his Goſpel, his Ordinances, his Saints, his wayes, &amp;c. as you and your partie have done, &amp;c? Notwithſtanding it be the very thing (and no other) which he in his ſaid Book ſaith, <hi>By faith he ſaw Chriſt in ſpirit,</hi> coming to perform, a few years before it was finiſhed; which few years, its like are now accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, it being about eight years ſince the ſaid Book was publiſhed; ſo then that which Chriſt cometh in ſpirit to perform, ye call the great deſign of the Devil, and a wicked practice, and thoſe who with Chriſt in his work are joined, bringing to paſs his determinations, ye ſay are joined with Papiſts, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſts, Ranters, and the ungodly rabble of the world.</p>

            <p>They ſay, <hi>In the name of the Lord, and in obedience to his command, and in a filial feare to God, love and pity to our ſouls, they did admoniſh,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply</hi> Did they know the name of the Lord, which is dreadfull to all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers, falſe prophets, and hypocrites, they would not dare to name it, whiles they live in iniquity; but out of his name are ye all ſhut, and have no porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in that which is a ſtrong tower, to which the righteous run, and are ſaved. Who for your rebellion and diſobedience againſt his name (who live out of his feare) which is the light of the world, are by the light judged and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62941:24"/>who in your vaine mindes talk of love and pirty to ſoules, but never came to witneſſe the living ſoul, nor the quickning ſpirit, where the true love and pity comes to be witneſſed.</p>
            <p>But did your three Meſſengers in the name, and in the fear, and in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Lord admoniſh? How then came it to paſſe, that they came to a near relation of mine, and told her, in the name of the Lord, &amp;c <hi>they were ſent to admoniſh her alſo of ſomething, as ſin.</hi> To which ſhe replyed to <hi>Robert Simpſon</hi> that ſpake, <hi>Haſt not thou ſomething in thee that tells thee thou doſt lye in the name of the Lord? For, what ſin do I live in which thou knoweſt?</hi> To which he ſaid; <hi>Dear ſiſter, I doe not ſay, in practice, but in judgement.</hi> To which ſhe replying, <hi>What is my judgement? Canſt thou tell?</hi> He appeared confounded, and ſaid, <hi>Doe not you heare thoſe men</hi> (meaning thoſe called Quakers) Now is not here deceit and wickedneſſe, to pretend to admoniſh people in the name, fear, and obedience of God, and at laſt know not for what, but aske if ſhe did not hear thoſe men, which <hi>Robert Simpſon</hi> himſelf had often done (it's like more often than ſhe at that time.) Now have ye not read that <hi>God is not mocked? but what ye ſowe, the ſame yee muſt reape.</hi> Why then doe yee thus <hi>to the fleſh ſowe corruption,</hi> falſhood, lying and deceit, and make mention of <hi>the name of the Lord</hi> as your covering?</p>
            <p>To what they ſaid to me in particular, I need not ſay much, becauſe what I ſaid before ſtands unanſwered, and in power over your heads, only they ſay, the things they charged me withal are true, every ſyllable, as appears by the foregoing anſwer of the whole Church, which is falſe, and thoſe they call the Church proved lyars: And whereas they ſay, they did not feare me, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did their conſciences accuſe them. In this they preſently gave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the lie, and ſay the reaſon they ſtaid not was, becauſe they found my ſpirit the time before as a boyling fornace boyling over, and ſcalding all that ſtand near it, which made them reſolve not to ſtay the ſecond time. Now what deceit and wickedneſſe is here? Who can believe a word that comes from amongſt you, who are out of the feare of God, and therefore regard not what ye ſay. For I having charged them in my laſt, that they fled as men ſurprized with feare, or accuſed by their own conſciences: They deny it, and ſay it is falſe, and that they neither feared me, nor were accuſed, &amp;c. And yet in 6. or 8, lines have fully granted what I ſaid, ſaying the reaſon they ſtaid not, was becauſe they found my ſprrit as a boyling fornace, boyling over and ſcalding, &amp;c. Now is it not evident, they feared leſt they ſhould be ſcalded? and what was there that ſcalded, but the witneſſe of God within themſelves? Poor men! I knew they were wounded, tormented, and ſcalded by the witneſs of God, in their own conſciences, teſtifying againſt their hypocriſie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, ſo that they could not ſtand, nor abide it; for the day of the Lord is now great, and who may abide it; for it is like refiners fire, <hi>yea it burns as an oven, and all that doe wickedly are as ſtubble,</hi> and not onely ſcalded, but burned muſt ye be, and neither root nor branch ſhall be left. And the falſe Prophets that ſee vanity, and divine lies, and all that imbrace and receive them, who muſt not be in the aſſembles of Gods people, are not in a capacity (as they ſay) for thoſe that feare the name of the Lord, to converſe withall. Neither is dried ſtubble in a capacity to contend with thoſe in whom the ſpirit of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and burning is, left thereby they be both ſcalded and burned.</p>
            <pb n="46" facs="tcp:62941:25"/>
            <p>But <hi>Robert Purnell</hi> and <hi>Robert Simpſon,</hi> were it not meet for you to take liced, &amp; beware, leſt (whiles ye pretend a Commiſſion from God, to admoniſh others for backſliding, who are not at all drawn back, but are of thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, to the ſalvation of their ſouls, <hi>who for the hope ſet before them, doe endure the Croſſe, &amp; deſpiſe the ſhame,</hi> and with much patience, through many tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>the race doe run, and through good report, and evil report, as deceivers, and yet true,</hi> do paſſe, <hi>preſsing on, if by any meanes they may attain to the reſurrection of the dead, and to apprehend that for which they are apprehended of Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>) Ye your ſelves be not found in Satans work, and indeed gone back, by many degrees into the world, and the pollutions thereof, being intangled and overcome by that which once ye ſeemed in a meaſure to have eſcaped, and ſo your latter end become worſe then your beginning. And therefore to you, or to one of you I ſay, do not eate and drinke with the drunken, do not fill your ſelves with wine and ftrong drink, nor ſpend the creation of God upon your luſts: Do not ſpend your time out of the feare of the Lord, in pleaſure and wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in lightneſſe and vanity, abuſing the ſervants of the Lord, <hi>For he is at the door, and ye know him not, that will cut you aſunder</hi> (except ye repent) and all your inventions, traditions, fooliſh cuſtomes, and carnall waſhings, will not hide nor help you: And this is a warning to thoſe of you <hi>that forget God, and caſt his law,</hi> which is light, <hi>behinde your backs,</hi> to conſider, <hi>leſt he teare you in pieces, and there be none to deliver you,</hi> who as unſavourie ſalt are become, whoſe ill ſavour is gone abroad from Alehouſes and Taverns (too much frequented) ſporting your ſelves with the enemies of God, with which ye now begin to appear as one, rather than to be grieved for the afflictions of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> or to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come companions of thoſe, who for witneſſing the power and life of Jeſus, do ſuffer by the world, the generation of Vipers, as ever they did of old. And this is all the fruit I know that your invented waſhings have brought you to, and yet for this time I do very much ſpare one of you.</p>
            <p>But why are <hi>Robert Simpſon</hi> and <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> ſo much troubled, that my letters to each of them are made publique; for what is publiſhed was written to them many moneths before, without an intent to publiſh it, and in all that time, which one of them acknowledgeth, was above a yeare, no anſwer was given in word or writing, nor any word ſpoken to me about it by them, teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying diſlike, as if all were quiet and well. But now it's made publique, and brought to light, and their deeds ſeen and openly reproved, how angry do they appear, crying out of wrong, lies, &amp;c. and after me pour their floods of contempt, reproach and ſcorn, notwithſtanding, under their hands it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, I was before called their honoured Brother, and when of worldly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours I could accept (though I did not, as others ſeek it) and when into his mouth I could freely put, <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> to me cryed peace, and in my abſence declared he had little or no encouragement to abide in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> were it not for me But ſince to the light I have been turned, and by it convinced of the blindneſs and falſeneſs of your minds and worſhips, and could not <hi>put into his mouth,</hi> as before, hovv doth he <hi>bite with the teeth, and prepare war againſt me,</hi> though his weapons appear too weak and carnall to prevail, againſt which the bowe is in ſtrength; and the Reader, whoſe eyes are opened, will eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that had not the things been true, which to each of them I writ, and not at all to be gainſaid, nor contradicted, they would in all that time, either in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62941:25"/>words or writing, plead their own innocency againſt me, who had ſo much wronged them as now they pretend: But being very true, and not to be gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, the ſubtileſt beaſt in the field (it's like) perſwades them to be quiet, that it be not noiſed abroad, but in oblivion kept: But ſince, beyond their expectation it is come to light, and they cannot prevent it; ſome courſe (if it be poſſible) muſt be taken, that it be not believed. And therefore (how falſly ſoever accuſed) it muſt be of lyes, falſhood, and folly, though themſelves feel the power of it, ſtanding in truth and wiſdome, and have not told the Reader in what the folly and falſhood lies: But (by all the means they are able) labour to recover a veil, though but little have either they or you done, more then to enſnare your ſelves in your own vvorks, whoſe webb is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a garment, neither do your works profit, for your works are works of vanity: But how comes it to paſſe, that my letters were true, and not to be contradicted before they vvere publiſhed, but are not ſo novv? Why onely thus, our skirts are diſcovered, our ſepulchre is opened, and our nakedneſſe is novv made manifeſt, that people (as vve paſſe the ſtreet) point us out <hi>Noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,</hi> and at us vvag the head; ſo that before the people (that are not vvilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blinde) vve and our povverleſs, hypocritical profeſſion (vvhich ſtands in vvords and forms, not in ſpirit and povver) are like to receive but little ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
            <p>Novv becauſe they have vvritten ſeverally, I ſhall reply particularly: And firſt to <hi>Robert Simpſon,</hi> in vvhom (me thinks) I ſee moſt honeſty, though it be clouded and covered vvith much deceit and hypocriſie, vvhich the light reproves: And had I not a deſire very much to ſpare him, for the honeſties ſake, the ſecond ſtroak vvould exceed the firſt: And becauſe I perceive his main vvork (as vvell as yours) is to ſeek a veile of deceipt, under vvhich to hide himſelfe from the ſtroke of truth, and to attain it, ſpends himſelfe in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny light, vaine, and angry words, which have little weight, I ſhall not trouble my ſelfe, nor the Reader in ſpeaking much to it, for of it ſelfe it falls, yet I would not that he ſhould ſo often take the name of the Lord in vaine, as he doth in the beginning of what he ſpeaks, <hi>for the Lord will not hold him guiltleſs.</hi> But in page 29. he ſaith, <hi>If the charge I laid upon him were ſo indeed, how ſad were his condition? Well might his countenance be changed, and his thoughts trouble him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I reply, That though he hath laboured till (he ſaith) he hath forgotten himſelfe, to vindicate or cover himſelf from what was truly laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, yet from it hath he not delivered himſelfe, but the charge ſtands good, in ſound and ſober words, in the power of truth, and <hi>whiles he covereth his ſin be cannot proſper.</hi> And whiles he addeth one iniquity to another, he cannot come into Gods righteouſneſſe: And oh! that he would conſider it, and lay it to heart whiles he hath time, that in the day of the Lords anger, which is at hand, and as a deſtruction from the Almighty ſhall come, he might be hid and find mercy of the Lord, with whom his vain ſpeaking of a witneſſe he hath in heaven brought from thence into his heart, and confirmed by the Spirit of Truth, and of his being taken up into the Mount to confer with him, who hath all power given him and of a Warrant ſealed and given forth <hi>from him that hath al power,</hi> &amp;c. is of little accompt, whiles he underſtands not what he ſpeaks; <hi>For the Kingdom of God cometh not with obſervation, but the kingdome of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62941:26"/>God is within,</hi> and in his Kingdom he is who dwells in heaven, where the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Word and Spirit agree, of which all blind Phariſaical Profeſſors are ignorant and cannot know it, till in the light, and by the ſpirit it be revealed and made manifeſt.</p>
            <p>And whereas he ſaith, <hi>All that he, with the reſt, laid at my door, was to a tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle true; and that neither he nor his brethren have any reluctance for it.</hi> This is all falſ, for I have before proved it lies and deceit, and themſelves have confeſt they found that which boiled like a furnace, and ſcalded all that ſtand near it, and they were near it, and ſo reſolved not to ſtay another time. And judgement is now laid to the line, and righteouſneſs to the plummet, and all refuges of lies and deceit are to be ſwept away, and by truth and ſoberneſs ſuch hiding places are overflown, and in ſoberneſs do I ſtand; and ſo much to my ſelf am I come, that I ſee many of his words there mentioned to veil and cover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to be light and vain, and not worth anſwering, and that what I writ, was both ſober and true, without fawning and flattery, in which many among you are too much exerciſed, who love to have ſmooth, not true things ſpoken, and would have me peaceable, gentle, and full of mercy to hypocriſie, deceit and wickedneſs, all which is for judgement, and no peace from God is ſpoken to it. And therefore without partiality do I declare againſt it in him and you, as well as in others, and to my ſelf am I not a ſtranger. And this is pure wiſdom from above, and moderation, known unto all that receive and believe in the light, by which that ſpirit appearing in my former book, is juſtified, though to you that hate the light, and by the light are condemned it is as gall and worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word. And for ſporting my ſelf, and inſulting over him; I did it not, but it is another refuge of lies; for I told him before, I did not inſult over him, nor delight in his wo and miſery, but was ſorely grieved, as ſtill I am, to ſee how the wicked one, whom the Lord would deſtroy, was exalted in him and you, and what I writ is true. And whereas he ſaith, I was not a in a ſober mind, but at a diſtance from it, and true ſpeaking (when I mentioned to him the portion of lyars) and that not any thing he ſaid was a lie, but what he ſaid I had not his hand to, as his particular affirmation; and ſo goes on ſpeaking many words, but to what purpoſe I cannot ſee, except it be by words to darken the Readers underſtanding. But if I miſtake not, that which he would do, is to vindicate himſelf from being a lyar, with what elſe I charged upon him in my former Letter, by telling me he ſaid I had not his hand to it, as his particular accuſation. And if this be his meaning, then is it groſs deceit, for I never ſaid or thought it was his particular accuſation, but a general accuſation deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by him, in which himſelf and each other particular, was included, and ſo I ſpake to him in ſoberneſs and pitty, my very howels moving towards him, knowing my ſelf innocent, and that it was a dreadful thing for him in the Name or the Lord to ſpeak a falſe viſion or thing. I asked him, how he durſt come to me, and in the name of the Lord tell me, I ſaid the Scriptures of truth were one of the greateſt plagues of the land, when I never ſpake nor thought ſuch a thing. To which he replyed, <hi>he never ſpake it, nor laid it to my charge,</hi> though out of his own mouth it came; and when I told him I had it under his hand, he denyed it. When I told him I could ſhew it him, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>if I could, he would acknowledge himſelf a lyar;</hi> upon which ground I char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him for it as before, and ſo I do ſtill, and good were it for him, if he own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62941:26"/>the judgement and repented, for otherwiſe he cannot eſcape. But if he forgeting that his hand was to his paper, did run himſelf into the evil of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying it, as is before expreſt; yet if (when he came to the ſight of his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror) he had clearly acknowledged it, and owned his condemnation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented, to which in love he was adviſed, there had been mercy for him: but being convinced and reproved of the evil, hardened his neck, and labours to hide and cover his ſin, adding one iniquity unto another; here he cannot proſper, but brings himſelf juſtly under, not onely the judgement and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation mentioned in my former Letter, but more and more miſery due to thoſe that rebel againſt the light, by which they are reproved, and to thoſe that add iniquity unto iniquity, and muſt not come into Gods righteouſneſs. And from it all the waters in <hi>Jordan</hi> can never waſh him, not the Rocks and Mountains cover him, nor all your outward obſervations, imaginations and will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhips, preſerve him, till he own the light, by which he is convinced and reproved, and the juſt condemnation thereof paſs upon the rebellious, and the tranſgreſſor which hath ſinned, and he brought to repentance, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the truth; and ſo his ſoul come to be ſaved in this migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty day of the Lords power. And this is not from a violent heat of wild-fire, as he calls it, but from a ſpirit of ſoberneſs, ſoundneſs and truth, and is true love to his ſoul; and the time is near, in which he that rebuketh plainly ſhall find more favour then he that flattereth with his lips, and my end is not to make him a tranſgreſſor before all, as he ſuppoſeth, but according to my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to adviſe him, into the way, the light, the life and the truth, which lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth out of tranſgreſſion, into the inheritance of the Saints in light; and in this I do not equivocate, nor evade, as he falſely chargeth me, but do ſpeak plainly and truly, though at it, both he and ye are offended. And both Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm and the Lords Supper I do own, as before I ſaid; and all your traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, imaginations, inventions carnal obſervations and will-worſhips I do deny, who in the many things (about which ye are troubled) oftend all, and are not come to the one Baptiſm, by which the Saints were baptized into one body; nor know not the Cup of the New Teſtament, nor the bread of life, which is the life of men, nor the fruit of the Vine, of which Chriſt with his Diſciples drank new in his Fathers Kingdom; and ſo are feeding your ſelves with that which will never ſatisfie, but is corruptible, and muſt periſh in the uſing. And the ground on which ye ſtand and queſtion me is not good, but of God is rejected, and bryars and thorns doth it bring forth, and its near unto curſing. And whereas he ſaith, though he was not preſent when I ſpake ſo reproachfully of the Scriptures, yet he did believe it, and ſtill doth.</p>
            <p>I <hi>Reply,</hi> Here is plainly, and without equivocation, as he calls it, the ground of your lies and ſlanders, falſe accuſations and charges, as well as of your windy, heady, and powerleſs Religion, (that is to ſay) your believing things, which ye neither heard nor ſaw, but have got by tradition and hearſay from others, as he confeſſeth of himſelf in this particular, and few can believe it beſides thoſe that are given over to believe lyes, becauſe there is no truth at all in it. And although he ſaith, I had not his hand in particular, to what he heard not, yet I know I had it to the whole, of which that is a part; and I have it to that which he denies, and ſaith, I had it not; and well was it that I had it under hand, or elſe how ſtiffely would it be denyed and gainſayed, as it
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62941:27"/>was directly at firſt, and after plain conviction, what ſhuffling and deceit is here uſed amongſt you, to hide and cover it, though to little purpoſe? And had I not by the wiſdom of God, had a Coppy of your charge, ſigned by ſome of your ſelves, how muſt all your lyes and forged accuſations (which ye pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and ſay was <hi>verbatim,</hi> and proved to a tittle and ſyllable) paſs for truth, becauſe ye ſay it is ſo, which by the ſaid Coppy is proved not <hi>verbatim,</hi> nor is proved true, but the contrary.</p>
            <p>And whereas <hi>Robert Simpſon</hi> declares <hi>I had no ground at all, to lay that agrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of lying upon him,</hi> viz. a lye invented, a lye proſecuted, a lye denyed, and the lye proved, and afterwards adviſeth me not to evade nor equivocate, but ſpeak truly, and deal plainly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> I have before dealt ſo truly and plainly, without flattery, that ye are offended, yet I ſhall take his adviſe, and plainly declare, the lye was inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted amongſt you, when ye ſtudied your accuſations, the lye was proſecuted by your Meſſengers, who charged me with the guilt of what ye had falſely contrived. The lye was denyed by <hi>Robert Simpſon,</hi> when he denied that he ſpake ſuch a thing, or laid it to my charge, though I had it under his hand; and the lye by me ſtands proved, both on you and him, from which ye can never deliver your ſelves by all your ſhifting and ſtriving, but like a bird in the ſnare, the more ye ſtrive, the more ye are intangled, till ye acknowledge your iniquitie, and own your condemnation, and repent. And ſo <hi>Robert Simpſons</hi> weapons being but the wrath and deceivableneſs of man, and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der promiſe of a bleſſing from God, are found too carnal (as he acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) to war againſt the Lamb and his followers, whoſe weapons are not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal like his, but mighty, thorough God, to the pulling down, and laying low all high things, ſo that no lying refuges, nor deceitful coverings, are able to ſtand. But the Armies of the world, who follow the beaſt, to make war with the Lamb, do flie and fall before them. <hi>Glory to him that ſits upon the throne, and to the Lamb for evermore.</hi>

               <p>Now becauſe his word is ſo large, and ſo little of worth or wiſdom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62941:27"/>therein, being a parcel of dead and dull ſtuff. And becauſe his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, lightneſs and confuſion, is ſo plainly to be read in his own lines, by all that walk in the fear and counſel of the Lord, I ſhall not trouble my ſelf, nor the Reader, with anſwering every particular, as it lies, but rather out of his heap of confuſion, take up a little, letting the reſt remain.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, he finds fault with me, for publiſhing his acknowledging himſelf no Miniſter of the Goſpel, and declares the grounds on which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied himſelf a Miniſter, but not a Preacher of the Goſpel, but hath miſt to inſert the true ground upon which I ſo declared him; which was, that in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious diſpute or diſcourſe he hath not been able by the Scriptures to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain himſelf a Miniſter of the Goſpel, but made to acknowledge the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and that before ſeveral witneſſes But how is it, that he denied himſelf, as he ſaith, to be a Miniſter, but not a Preacher of the Goſpel? Did any ever preach the Goſpel, who had not the treaſure of it in their earthen veſſels? Or did ever any who had the treaſure within them, preach and not miniſter of the ſame, as good ſtewards of the grace of God? Truly, he that is ſuch a man (notwithſtanding he may vainly boaſt of his abilities, and approbation, and being ſent forth by men) had need to ſeek a better proof of his Miniſtry, or elſe muſt never be owned by Chriſt, as one of his.</p>
               <p>He ſaith, he denyed himſelf a Miniſter of any Pariſh in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> a Miniſter in Office, not having been called, conſtituted, or ordained, &amp;c And that he hath put off that honour and dignity, from a ſenſe of the weight and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of that high calling, and of the great unworthineſs and unfitneſs he ſaw in himſelf of ſo glorious an employment; but ſaith, that he hath been and is (though the unworthieſt upon earth) a Preacher and a publiſher of the glorious Goſpel of the grace of God, both in <hi>Wales,</hi> and now in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> he hath no need to ſeek a proof of me or any other man.</p>
               <p>To which I ſay, his own proof is too light and empty, to prove him a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of the Goſpel; and in it ſelf ſufficiently diſcovers him no Miniſter of Chriſt, but in confuſion; for the Miniſters of Chriſt were called, but he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth he was neither called, conſtituted, nor ordained a Miniſter in Office, which I take for granted, and then is he to prove that they who were no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, either called, conſtituted, or ordained, were preachers of the glorious Goſpel; and likewiſe, that they who were preachers of the Goſpel, were not Miniſters. But in this his ignorance, folly and confuſion, are made manifeſt, for can a man be a Preacher and publiſher of the glorious Goſpel, and yet no Miniſter, either called, conſtituted, or ordained? and can he that is no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, either called, conſtituted or ordained (as he hath confeſt he is not) be a publiſher, and a Preacher of the glorious Goſpel? Was not he a Miniſter? And did not he make full proof of his Miniſtry, who preached the Word, who did the work of an Evangeliſt? <hi>Paul</hi> was appointed a Preacher, and he was called to be an able Miniſter; but <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> hath not been able by the Scripture to maintain that he is a Miniſter, but enforced to deny the ſame; and now hath given it under his hand, that he was not called, conſtituted nor ordained; therefore being no Miniſter, he is no Preacher of the Goſpel, but in confuſion. And it is much to ſee what poor ſhifts the children of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are put unto, now in the day of the Lords power, wherein light is riſen out of obſcurity, and they that hate it are diſcovered, and to the leaſt child
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62941:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>of light, made manifeſt and denyed. Beſides, the Goſpel is the Goſpel of the kingdome; and to thoſe who were Preachers and publiſhers thereof, it was given to know the myſteries of that kingdom, which to others was in parables and dark ſayings, <hi>that ſeeing they might ſee, and not perceive,</hi> &amp;c. And the Goſpel is a great myſtery, which hath been hid from ages and generations, but is now made manifeſt to thoſe to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of that myſterie which (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>is Chriſt in you, the hope of glory, whom we preach;</hi> And by revelation, ſaith he, God made known unto me; the myſterie, and the hidden wiſdome of God we ſpeak in a myſterie, which God ordained before the world unto our glory, and that which none of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this world knew, <hi>nor eye hath ſeen, nor eare heard, neither hath it entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heart of man,</hi> hath God revealed unto them by his Spirit, who were the Miniſters of Chriſt, and Stewards of the myſteries of God: But <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> hath confeſt, that he did queſtion whether he had received the Spirit, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and reveal the myſteries of the Kingdome unto him, and ſo to him the viſion of all is but a ſealed book, and to him it is but in parables, and dark ſayings, as it was to ages, and generations paſt, to whom God revealed not the myſteries of his Spirit, but ſeeing, they did ſee, and not perceive. And how then can he be a Preacher or publiſher of the Goſpell, yea the glorious Goſpel which is the Goſpel of the kingdome, to whom it was never given to know it, neither hath he received the Spirit, to open and reveale it, as is manifeſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his hand. Poor man! were he not very blinde, he might be ſilent, and not boaſt to the world, that he needs not a proof of any man, that he is a Preacher and a Publiſher of the glorious Goſpel of the grace of God in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> who is ſo notoriouſly ignorant of it, that (by his own confeſſion) he hath not received the ſpirit, to open the myſterie of it to him, as the Saints had in the Primitive times, and ſo is intruding into things he hath not ſeen, vainly puft up with a fleſhly minde, and would needs be a Teacher, but underſtands not what he ſaith, nor whereof he affirmes, but confeſſeth, he queſtions whether he hath received the Spirit, to open and reveal the myſteries of the Kingdom, and yet ſaith he is a Preacher of the glorious Goſpel, which is a myſterie hid from all, but thoſe to whom it is revealed by the Spirit.</p>
               <p>But he ſaith, <hi>his reward is on high, and that God hath given him a ſeale of his Miniſtry in</hi> Briſtol, <hi>and he truſts hundreds can ſay, the Lord hath been, and ſtill is with his Miniſtry, quickning, comforting, teaching,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To which I ſay, whoſe work is this, or of what is it a ſeale? In page 52. he confeſſeth he queſtions whether he had received the ſpirit to ſeale, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet here ſaith, God gave him a ſeale of his Miniſtry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He hath before denied himſelfe a Miniſter and now given it under his hand, that he was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther called, conſtituted, nor ordained, &amp;c. and yet ſaith, his Record is on high, and that God hath given him a ſeale of his Miniſtry. Is he no Miniſter? and yet hath God given him a ſeal of his Miniſtry? What Babyloniſh confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is here? Hath he a ſeale of nothing? or of a lye? Can he have a ſeale of that which is not? Or hath he a ſeale and not of the Spirit? Is not the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord (he ſaith) he hath of this on high, even with principalities and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and ſpiritual wickedneſſes, where the powers of darkneſſe rule? But how ſhall one truſt? or in what can one believe ſuch a man, who would ſeem to ſpeak with ſo much ſolemneſſe and ſeriouſneſſe, when he ſpeaks ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62941:28"/>contradiction, and falſhood: And well were it, that not not onely he, but ye all would learn to dread the name of God, and feare to take it, ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly as ye do into your mouths in vain, to veile and cover your deceitfull pretences, leſt by him ye be not held guiltleſſe.</p>
               <p>But he ſaith, <hi>It is true, I am no preacher of that, which you, and ſome of your way call the Goſpell, namely to bid every man turn to the light within, neither did I ever read or heare that any of the Prophets, Apoſtles, or holy men of God, did preach ſuch a Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I ſay, he being no Preacher of that thing (as he terms it) which my ſelfe and ſome of our way call the Goſpel, he is no Preacher of the Truth of God, nor the Goſpel of God, <hi>which is the power of God to ſalvation to every one that believes.</hi> And ſo out of his own mouth let him be judged that he is no Preacher, nor Miniſter, either by call or practice, who doth not preach that which we call the Goſpel, <hi>which is not in word, but in power,</hi> And no other Goſpel do we own, but that which is the Goſpel of the kingdom, <hi>the power of God to ſalvation, which is not in word, but in power,</hi> and is the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hid from ages and generations, but is revealed by the Spirit to thoſe whom God would make known the riches of his glory, &amp;c. But, ſaith he, namely to bid every man turn to a light within.</p>
               <p>What then doth he bid them turn to, the darkneſſe? and to follow the darkneſſe? Doth he think that good Doctrine? <hi>Luke</hi> 11.34. <hi>The light of the body is the eye; therefore when thy eye is ſingle, thy whole body is full of light; but if thine eye he evill, thy whole bodie alſo is full of darkneſs. Take heed therefore, that the light which is in thee be not darkneſs.</hi> Where there is a ſingle eye, is not the body full of light? Where the eye is evill, is not the body full of darkneſſe? And was not this Chriſts doctrine, who bids people <hi>take heed that the light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them be not darkneſs?</hi> And were they not to take heed to that which was indeed light within them? of which the body was full where the eye was ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, and to walk in it. And the Apoſtle, who was a Preacher and a Miniſter of the Goſpel declared, <hi>that the light maketh manifeſt the things that are to be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> And alſo that which may be known of God, is manifeſted even in them vvhich vvere vvicked, and committed uncleanneſſe, yet ſtill they knevv the judgements of God againſt ſuch things. And is it not good to take heed to that vvhich manifeſts ſin, unrighteouſneſſe, and deceit, and brings to a knovvledge of the judgements of God againſt ſuch things; and if turned unto, and vvalked in, leads out of unrighteouſneſſe and all deceivableneſſe: But the light vvhich ſhines in the heart, to give the light of the knovvledge of the glory of God he likes not to retain: But hath ſhewed his ignorance or vvickedneſs, if not both, and is joyned amongſt the vaine rabble, and vvicked company, not only of the people, but alſo of thoſe called Teachers, vvhich himſelfe calls an ignorant, ungodly, lazie, proud, ſcandalous, ſoul-murthering Miniſtry, vvho have made themſelves baſe and contemptible in the eyes of all good men, and in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of many bad: And well were it, if he knew what that is in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of many bad: which joyns with all good men againſt ſuch a Miniſtry, who himſelfe with the bad is joyned in denying and oppoſing the light, of which the ſervants of God declare, and direct unto, and which the Prophets, Apoſtles, and holy men of God in Scripture did beare teſtimony of, and that true light, and no other, do thoſe whom he calls <hi>Quakers</hi> direct unto, which
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62941:29"/>the Scriptures abundantly make mention of. The Prophets, <hi>who ſpake as they were moved by the holy Ghoſt,</hi> preached and directed to the light, and groaned after the enjoyment thereof, ſaying, <hi>Ah! ſend out thy light and thy truth, and let them lead and bring me to thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacle,</hi> and accounted it mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery enough to go to the generation of their fathers, and not to ſee the light, which (ſay they) <hi>was ſowen for the righteous.</hi> And <hi>Iſaiah</hi> by the ſpirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie declared, that the people that ſate in darkneſſe ſaw a great light; <hi>and upon them that ſate in the ſhadow of death, hath the light ſhined:</hi> And that the light of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall be for a fire, and his holy one for a flame, which ſhould burn and devour his bryars and thorns in one day, And that a light to the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> would God give, that ſhould be his ſalvation to the ends of the earth: To which light the <hi>Gentiles ſhould come,</hi> and Kings to the brightneſſe of his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. And the Sun ſhall no more be thy light by day, nor for brightneſs ſhall the Moon give light unto thee; but the Lord ſhall be thine everlaſting light, and thy God thy glory. And Chriſt, <hi>who is the light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world,</hi> ſaith, <hi>I am come a light into the world,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Believe in the light.</hi> And <hi>John,</hi> who prepared his way, did beare witneſſe of him, <hi>that he was the true light which did enlighten every man that cometh into the world:</hi> And this is prepared before the face of all people, <hi>a light to lighten the Gentiles, to give light to them that ſit in darkneſſe,</hi> which is the glory of his people <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And after Chriſt was aſcended, and people were not to ſay in their hearts, <hi>Who ſhall aſcend to bring Chriſt down? or deſcend to fetch him up,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Paul</hi> a Miniſter of the Goſpel was ſent to turn peoples mindes <hi>from darkneſſe to the light;</hi> and to the light did he turn them, and ſaid, <hi>God who commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſſe, hath ſhined into our hearts,</hi> but to what end? Why, ſaith <hi>Paul, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God,</hi> &amp;c. But of this <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> is no Preacher, to wit, to turne people to the light within, which ſhines in the heart, to give the knowledge of the glory of God, &amp;c. But againſt this, ſaith he, came <hi>Henry Jeſſe</hi> from <hi>London,</hi> to eſtabliſh and confirm the people of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> &amp;c. This he calls the pernicious Doctrine of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and would perſwade his Reader, that thoſe who bid turn to the light within, do ſhut up the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven againſt men, and do thereby take them off from believing in the perſon of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But this is an abſolute lye, and in this he is one with the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> for they denyed the light, and oppoſed the truth, which enlihgtneth every man: And he proclaims himſelf no Preacher of that, namely, to tmrn to the light: So in this is he joyned with the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> to ſhut the Kingdome of heaven againſt men, by denying the Light. For no man can ever knew God, nor into his kingdome did enter, whilſt he denyed or oppoſed the light in him, but they that entred did owne it, and the ſaying of the Reprobate is not much to be heeded.</p>
               <p>He ſaith, he <hi>ſuppoſeth we would have him give over Preaching, and come to our way, and that one told him hee kept many from receiving and embracing the light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I ſay, He doth his uttermoſt to hinder, if his words or writing may do it, and with the God of the world, and all his Miniſters throughout the Nations is he joyned, to do what they can to keep blinde the mindes of all that believe not in the light, leſt the light of the glorious Goſpel <hi>ſhould ſhine
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62941:29"/>into their hearts, to give the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Chriſt.</hi> Yet indeed the good of his and all mens ſoules we do deſire; but all his hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, falſhood and deceit we do deny: And if he own our way, which is the true light, the true and living way, his mouth would ſoon be ſtopt for decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againſt it: And for all his denying it, he may once finde it a ſwift witneſſe againſt him, it may prove as a fire in his bowels, and as a candle to ſearch his in moſt parts; and the condemnation it is of all thoſe that hate it, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture witneſſeth. And Chriſt exhorts to believe in it, and in it did the Saints walke, and in it had they fellowſhip, which condemns the unbeliever: But of it he is no Preacher, and therefore do we confeſs he is no Miniſter for God, for though in words he ſeems to confeſſe ſomething of the light, yet like a man filled with confuſion, ſpeaks he knows not what, but uttereth his owne folly, and ſpeaks of a two-fold coming of the Spirit into the hearts of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: The firſt is that by which the eyes of mens underſtandings are opened, and they turne from darkneſſe to light, faith and repentance wrought in the ſoul, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Upon which I demand, were they believers before they were turned unto the light in which they were to believe, or had their eyes opened? If yea, prove it; If nay, then by his own confeſſion, there were eyes of mens under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings to be opened, and light to be turned unto; and yet he ſaith, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read nor heard that the Prophets, Apoſtles, or holy men of God preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch a Goſpel, namely, to bid people turn to the light, &amp;c. Now how ſhall we truſt him? or which of his words ſhall we believe? who confeſſeth he is no Miniſter but uncal'd, unconſtituted, unordained, &amp;c. No Preacher of that thing we call the Goſpel, namely to bid men turn to a light within them, and yet the eyes of mens underſtandings muſt be opened, and they turned to the light, and yet ſaith he, to bid men turn to the light within, takes them off from believing on the perſon of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>He ſaith, <hi>He adminiſters the Lords Supper to this people in</hi> Briſtol, <hi>as they are a Church of godly ſober Chriſtians believing in Chriſt, though ſome of them miſ-bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, not having light to ſee right Adminiſtrations, but reckon infant-baptiſme ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient; yet as further light comes in, they are willing to walke up in it: In the meane time we can beare with them in love, as we deſire them and others, to leave with us in other things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to it I ſay; Though ye be joyned hand in hand in darkneſſe and deceit, agreeing to bear with one another therein: Yet the children of light, plainly and clearly ſee your folly and confuſion, and bear witneſſe againſt it. <hi>Tho: Ewins</hi> declares himſelfe againſt bidding turn to the light within! yet his miſ-bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed people, as he calls them, have not light to ſee the right Adminiſtrations of Baptiſme, but reckon Infant-baptiſme ſufficient, <hi>yet as further light comes in,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>they are willing to walke up in it.</hi> So then he acknowledgeth they want light to ſee: And that, as light comes in, I ſay, as it comes in, they are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to walk up in it (&amp; yet he ſays) he is no Preacher of this thing, to wit, the light within. It is pernitious doctrine; It ſhuts up the Kingdome againſt men, and takes them off from believing on the perſon of Chriſt. Poor blind man! how is he made to condemn himſelfe, in that which he in words is forced to allow. But theſe miſ-baptized people, who have not light to ſee right Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations, but reckon Infant-baptiſme ſufficient, are his believers, and with one another can ye beare in love, in your darkneſſe: It is like he knows in his
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62941:30"/>own conſcience that infant-baptiſme is not ſufficient, being neither he nor you can prove it an Ordinance of Chriſt, and ſo follow traditions for Doctrines: And its no wonder that they want light, who follow ſuch a guide. who hath ſo plainly denyed the ſame, and would fain be a Teacher, but underſtands nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what he ſaith, nor whereof he affirmeth.</p>
               <p>But he ſaith <hi>truly, I know no thorough-paced godly man, Anabaptiſt, or others in</hi> Briſtol, <hi>but do ſhew love and reſpect to me in their way, onely in this, they walke according to their light, and ſo do I; but they thinke I am too large in my principles, and I thinke them too ſtreight in theirs; Yet,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>we doe not differ, but can beare with each other in love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> Here again is his confuſion manifeſt: He denies them who bid turne to the light, and he is no Preacher of that, and yet his miſ-baptized people want light, and thoſe he calls thorough-paced Anabaptiſt, or others, who ſhew reſpect to him in their way. They walk in their light, and he in his, and yet to bid turn to the light, is to deny believing in the perſon of Chriſt. Now let all who feare the Lord, conſider his words, who ſaith he is no Preacher of that we call Goſpel, namely, to bid every man turn to the light in him: And the <hi>Quakers</hi> doctrine is pernicious, they ſhut the kingdome of Heaven from men; they take people off from believing in the perſon of Chriſt, by bidding them turn to the light in them (ſaith he) and yet himſelfe acknowledgeth the firſt coming of the Spirit is to open the eyes of mens underſtandings, and to turne them from darkneſſe to light, and to work faith and repentance in the ſoule. Now according to his own words, are not they in darkneſſe, and unconverted, who are not turned to the light? And is it not good to turn to the light, that the eyes may be opened, and the ſoul converted? And yet he is no Preacher of this.</p>
               <p>Again he ſaith, <hi>the miſ-baptized people want light, but as further light comes in, they are willing to walk up in it.</hi> Here is want of light confeſſed, and the coming in of light acknowledge, and the turning to the light was before granted, and yet to bid people turn to the light within is pernicious doctrine. By this is the Kingdome ſhut: Oh miſerable blinde guide, and Idoll ſhepherd! how hath groſſe darkneſſe overſpread thy face? and thy Sun gone downe at noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</p>
               <p>Again, Them he calls <hi>thorough-paced Anabaptiſts, they walke according to their light, and he walks according to his; they think his principles too large, and he thinks theirs too ſtreight.</hi> Here is acknowledged their light and his light, and before, want of light, and coming in of light. And yet <hi>Quakers</hi> have done miſchief in <hi>Briſtol, and their doctrine,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is pernitious,</hi> how ſo? why, <hi>they bid men turn to the light within them.</hi> Poor man! what is become of his rule now for turning to the light, that is pernicious doctrine. To try things by the light, were to deny Scripture to be the rule: But now with him, here is their light, and his light, ſtreight and large principles, and mis-baptized ones that want light to ſee right adminiſtrations, &amp;c. But now, by what are ye guided? and where, and what is your rule? Have ye not all loſt it? and are all gone out of the right way, wandring ye know not where, in your imaginations, who rebell againſt the light, and know not the way thereof, nor abide in its paths: And in your own darkneſſe are joyned, every one againſt the ſervants of God, who bid turn to the light, which is pure, <hi>which lighteth every man that cometh into the world,</hi> which is no pernitious, (but ſound) Doctrine; for if it be good to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62941:30"/>watch, and good to walk in the true light, then it is good to turn men to that light. And if the Lord would have all men to come to the knowledge of the truth, then it is good that all men be turned to the light, which ſhines in the heart, to give the knowledge of it, in the ſace of Chriſt, and to bid peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to take heed to that light, to walk in that light, and believe in the light, which lighteth every man, that is ſound doctrine, and thoſe that love not the light, nor walk in the light, nor believe in the light, are left without excuſe, and the light come is their condemnation, and by the light are they already condemned, who believe not in the light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world; and (whatſoever the falſe Prophets and Miniſters of unrighteouſneſs ſay to the contrary) is of little weight.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Robert Sympſon,</hi> in pag. 33. declares, <hi>that that light which is in me, and in all men, if not put out, would tell me, that that thing which he there aſſerts, is true.</hi> Now here is light confeſt to be in me, and in all men, and that light to be in all men, which is in me (and the Scripture ſaith, <hi>that was the true light which lighteth every man</hi>) which ſhould anſwer that which he affirms and minds to be truth, if not put out; And if ſo, then that is a good Miniſtry which opens blind eyes, and turns from darkneſs to light. Then, it being ſo, what have thoſe ſervants of the Lord done, for which thou ſo highly chargeſt them who are ſent of the Lord, to bear witneſs of his name, and to declare his truth, and bids take heed to the true light, and turns to it to the opening of the blind eyes, that people may ſee the way to everlaſting life, and have their feet guided in the way of peace, with whom the Lord of a truth is; though <hi>Thomas Ewins,</hi> with the reſt of the deceitful workers, and Miniſters of Satan (who love darkneſs, and hate the light) do reproach and belye them, he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering his confuſion and envy againſt the innocent, telling the world, the <hi>Quakers</hi> (as he calls them) have done ſuch miſchief, and their doctrine is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious, they bid all men turn to the light, thereby to draw them from belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the perſon of Chriſt; and he is no Preacher of that thing they call Goſpel, and calls them miſerable deluded people. Oh vain man! who boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thy ſelf in thine evil way; how is night come upon thee, and darkneſs over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadoweth thee? And how art thou reeling and ſtaggering like a drunken man, who haſt ſpoken and written ſo of the light, thy ſelf, as is before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, &amp; yet art not aſhamed to belie and reproach the ſervants of the living God, as thou haſt done, for labouring to turn people from darknes to the light, who having received a Miniſtery from the Lord, as all the Miniſters of Chriſt did, not from men, as the falſe Apoſtles and deceitful workers and Miniſters of Satan did; they labour, not accompting their liberties nor lives dear unto them, ſo that they may finiſh their courſe with joy, and the Miniſtry, which of the Lord Jeſus they have received and therfore in much patience, in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in neceſſities, in diſtreſſes, in ſtripes, in impriſonments, in tumults, in labours by knowledge, by long ſuffering, by kindneſs, by the holy Ghoſt, by love un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned, by the Word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by honour and diſhonour, by evil report, and good report, as deceivers, and yet true, &amp;c. do they approve themſelves the Miniſters of Chriſt, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed it is in the conſciences of men. And <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> words, being ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly conſidered, with what is replyed thereunto, may not his own ſayings be juſtly turned upon his head, pag. 49. may he not bluſh to ſpeak or write ſuch things? Will <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the great and glorious God ever own ſuch railings
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62941:31"/>and revilings (to which I add) lying and deceiving, to be a teſtifying from him? Or will he ever juſtifie him in what he hath written and publiſhed? Oh! be aſhamed and confounded, poor deluded man; for how hath he manifeſted himſelf a blind guide? They, (that is, the Anabaptiſts) think he is too large in his principles, and he thinks them too ſtraight in theirs, and yet they do not differ, but can bear with each other in love. Truly the Devil may love his own work, which is to lead people in darkneſs and blindneſs, and there have his inſtruments fellowſhip. But will any man that fears God, and weighs his words, believe (or own him in) what he ſaith? How can it be that they ſhould think one thing and he another? he have large principles, and they ſtreight? they in their light, and he in his, and yet not differ? And may not he be juſtly reproved, as well as the Authour of <hi>Satan enthroned in his Chair of Peſtilence</hi> in that they both agree to charge miſchief done in <hi>Briſtol</hi> on thoſe called <hi>Quakers.</hi> And <hi>Tho. Ewins</hi> is in that joyned with <hi>R. F.</hi> one walking in his light, and the other in his, yet they differ not, but are both oppoſers of the true light, and the children thereof, who in the ſame do walk as were their fathers in all generations. But in it are they both diſcovered to be out of the right way, and the children of light, who walk in the light, ſtand witneſſes for the Lord againſt them both, and that principle of darkneſſe, blindeneſſe and deceit in which they walk, and from which their corrupted works of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling and perſecuting the innocent without a cauſe proceeds. But the day is come in which the Lord is gathering his people from ſuch (to give <hi>T.

I ſay leaſt the light which God commands to ſhine out of darkneſſe, ſhould ſhine into the heart, to give the knowledge of the glory of God, of which light, and no other, the ſervants of God declare, and your folly is manifeſting apace, glory to the Lord for evermore; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he that preacheth the Goſpel witneſſeth the new covenant where the law is written in the heart and the ſpirit, put into the inward parts, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the ſcripture witneſſeth that the law is light and written in the heart, and that the word is <hi>within</hi> in the heart and in the mouth,<note place="margin">Prov. 6.23.

               </p>
               <p>And for his ſpeaking of <hi>Sarah Latchet,</hi> &amp; aſking <hi>how</hi> I <hi>can ſtile her a Servant of Jeſus, who is an Apoſtate, and an excommunicated perſon, going on in ſuch rayling, and calling him a deceiver?</hi> Another time ſaying, <hi>the prayers of the wicked are an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homination to the Lord.</hi> And another time let fly at him with a multitude of rayling and reviling terms, ſuch, as he ſaith, they uſe to give to the Miniſters of the Nation, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To this I ſay, In that ſhe did bear true Teſtimony againſt him, I own it as a ſervice in the Truth, and her being excommunicated as he cals it, by thoſe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62941:31"/>who deny the true light, proves nothing to the contrary, nor her calling him <hi>deceiver,</hi> or ſaying <hi>the prayers of the wicked are abhomination to the Lord,</hi> for ſo are their ſervices and ſacrifices, and to deny and bear Teſtimony againſt it is no A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy, upon a true account, and to be hated and ſeparated by ſuch, from their company, and by them to be reproached, and to have ones name caſt out as evil, for the Son of mans ſake, <hi>who is the light of the World,</hi> is a bleſſed thing, rejoyce ye in that day, and leap for joy, <hi>for behold your reward is great in heaven, for in like manner did their fathers unto the prophets, Luke</hi> 6.22, 23. and his word <hi>(excommunication)</hi> is turned back into his bundle of Popiſh or Heatheniſh ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, as that which was never uſed by the Miniſters of Chriſt. And if <hi>Sarah Latchet</hi> be excommunicated (as he calls it) then its like thoſe that did it are aſhamed of their work, for ſhe knew it not; but ſaith he, ſhe let flie at me, with ſuch railing termes as they uſe to give the Miniſters of the Nation.</p>
               <p>To which I ſay, why ſhould not he be teſtified againſt as well as they, being at leaſt in many things found in their ſteps and practices: But for reviling ſpeeches let him look at home. He ſaith, ſhe called him Deceiver, and ſaid, <hi>the prayers of the wicked were abhomination to the Lord,</hi> and this by him is term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rayling and reviling, though it be according to the Scriptures, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from thoſe that ſpake <hi>as they were moved of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> But he in his anſwer to <hi>Ralph Farmer,</hi> ſaith, the in-let and out-let, the fore-door and back-door of much of <hi>Englands</hi> miſery, and conſequently of <hi>Briſtols,</hi> is an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, ungodly, lazie, proud, ſcandalous, ſoule-murthering Miniſtry, who have made themſelves contemptible and baſe in the eyes of all good men, and in the conſciences of many bad. Now if this be ſo, the Quakers (as he calls them) did not all the miſchief in <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> as he falſly ſaith they did, for now he ſaith, the in-let and out-let, the fore-door and back-door of much of the miſery of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Briſtol,</hi> is an ignorant, ungodly, lazie, proud, ſcandalous, ſoule-murthering Miniſtry: And ſo hath he proved himſelfe a lyar, and a falſe accuſer, which the Miniſters of Chriſt were not But who is the rayler and reviler now? They that bear true teſtimony againſt him and his generation, according to Scripture? or <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> in ſpeaking his own corrupted words out of his polluted and unſanctified fountain, who by his own confeſſion que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions whether ever he had received the Spirit, to purge and purifie, cleanſe and ſanctifie believers, and make them holy: But if it be ſo, that the miſery of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> is ſuch a Miniſtry as he hath before expreſt, and which he terms the Miniſtry of the Nation, ought they not to be teſtified againſt? and he alſo, ſo far as he is found in their condition? And may it not well be ſaid, that it is the great miſery of many poor ſouls in <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> that ſuch ignorant and blinde guides as ye are, are followed, which is the in-let and out-let, the fore-door and back door of ſo much confuſion, as is at this day amongſt you, one bearing with the other in your darkneſſe, and in your ſtreight and large prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, till ye become all quite blinde, and ſtark drunk in your imaginations, reeling and ſtaggering, ſo that many poor people are even at their wits end, and have followed you ſo long, till their ſoules are even famiſhed, and they fallen into miſery. But glory to the Lord God of life, who hath cauſed light to ſhine out of darkneſſe, and out of obſcurity, by which the deceitfull veiles and coverings of the ſoul-murthering Miniſtry are made manifeſt.</p>
               <p>And were thoſe ſavoury words for <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> to ſay, <hi>It were fitter ſuch an
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62941:32"/>idle huſwife were whipt, and ſent to Bridewell to worke, then to goe about rayling at people as ſhe did?</hi> Let ſhame cover his face for ever, when he looks back on his own words, which are ſo well like the words and deeds of the Miniſters of the Nation, which himſelfe calls the ſoul-murthering Miniſtry, that he which reads, may eaſily perceive them to agree, and that one and the ſame ſpirit leads and guides them all. And did not <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> let flye at her in envy, when he ſpake ſuch words, and hath thus confeſt it, to his ſhame among thoſe that are not willing to joyn hand with the wicked, and to take part with evill doers: And for his ſaying that ſhe curſed and rayled, that is but the invented refuge of his lying ſpirit, for the words he ſets down as hers, are no ſuch things. And for his charging her to be idle, that is from the ſame root of lying, ſhe having been known to be diligent in an honeſt employment, and lives not by others labours, as do the ſoul-murthering Miniſters as he calls them, who preach for hire, and divine for money, and againſt thoſe that put not into their mouths, they prepare war: And take liberty to themſelves from their high places, to reproach, revile, ſlander and belye them that feare the Lord, and are obedient to Chriſt the light of the world: But if any who feel the burthen of the word of the Lord, and witneſſe it, as a fire in their bones, and being weary of holding it in, are made to pour it out againſt the ſoul-murthering Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, &amp;c. For this, they muſt to the whip, to priſon, to Bridewell, &amp;c. And in this <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> is diſcovered: And for his ſaying, ô be aſhamed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, poor deceived man, becauſe I ſaid, ſhe teſtified from the Lord: I ſay his own words are turned upon his own head, and to bear witneſſe in truth againſt his deceit, I call a teſtifying from the Lord: And it's apparent it reacht him, and his bottome was ſtirred up, to give forth ſuch filthy unſavoury words, more like a perſecuter, then a Miniſter of Chriſt; ſo that he may well bluſh, to write his own folly and confuſion, for me his words reach not.</p>
               <p>But he would deviſe a thing of his own, and make a little Logick, as he calls it, to ſhew his skill, and to evade the thing in hand: And when he hath utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his abhominable lyes, asks, is this good Logick? I ſay it is his own, and not being good, he may be aſhamed of it; for they that read his lines, may read his folly. He ſaith, in my letter I endeavour to parallel her with <hi>Paul,</hi> and her ſufferings with <hi>Pauls</hi> ſufferings, &amp; him with <hi>Pauls</hi> perſecutors: All which is ſo notoriouſly falſe, and from the father of lyes, that were he not paſt feeling, a man would marvail how, without bluſhing, he can write ſuch plain lyes, and untruths, when nothing like ſuch a thing appears in my letter to him, as the Reader may ſee. In which letter I do not ſo much as once mention her name, much leſſe do I endeavour to parallel her with <hi>Paul,</hi> or her ſufferings with <hi>Pauls</hi> ſufferings: But that which I did was, to reprove <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> for his unſavoury words and practices in oppoſing the truth, and them that come to witneſſe againſt his deceit, whom he threatned with <hi>Bridewell,</hi> with whipping, &amp;c. And by his fruits I tryed him, according to the Scriptures, &amp; found him out of the practice of the true Miniſters of Chriſt, and directly in the ſteps and practices of the enemies of Chriſt, and his Goſpel, and therefore plainly told him it was the Devill that caſt the Saints into priſon; It was wretched <hi>Pilate</hi> that ſcourged Jeſus: It was thoſe Maſters, whoſe gain came in by divination, joyning with the rude multitude, that carryed <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> before the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, and cauſed them to be beaten, and caſt into priſon; It was Jeſus that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62941:32"/>told his Diſciples they muſt be ſo uſed by the world, the generation of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, &amp;c. It was <hi>Paul</hi> the able Miniſter of the Spirit, and not of the Letter, that proved himſelfe the Miniſter of God in patience, in tumults, in ſtripes, in impriſonments, &amp;c. But it was <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> a Miniſter of the letter, and not of the Spirit, that is, threatning the ſervants of God, &amp; witneſſes of Jeſus, with ſtripes, with whips, &amp; with <hi>Bridewel.</hi> Now let all that read, but honeſtly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, hovv from theſe expreſſions, and the like, a man vvho hath any fear of God vvithin him, can be ſo knovvingly wicked, as to <hi>affirme in print that I endeavour to compare her with</hi> Paul, <hi>and her ſufferings with his.</hi> And hovv vvofully (it is like) by vvicked art, he can corrupt the Scriptures, and bely the Prophets, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and holy men of God that gave them forth, vvho are deceaſed, that dares to affirme things ſo directly falſe and untrue, as done and publiſhed by a man, vvhom he knovvs to be yet alive, and able enough to ſee and diſcover his vvickedneſſe. And hovv blinde, and like to fall into the ditch are all thoſe that vvill believe, or receive for truth all that comes from ſo falſe a ſpeaker, vvho, I might eaſily prove is far out of <hi>Pauls</hi> condition, vvho vvas a Miniſter of Chriſt, and Preacher of the Goſpel, and called to the vvork. But <hi>Thomas Ew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins</hi> hath denyed that he is a Miniſter, either called, conſtituted, or ordained; And therefore is he no Preacher of the Goſpel. <hi>Paul</hi> vvas ſent to turn the Gentiles from darkneſſe to the light. But <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> ſaith, to bid people turn to the light vvithin, is to cauſe them to ceaſe from believing in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt. And he is no Preacher of that, namely, to bid people turn to the light. Therefore is he no Preacher of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Paul</hi> and the Miniſters of Chriſt in meekneſſe inſtructed thoſe vvhich oppoſed themſelves. But <hi>Thomas Ewins,</hi> vvhen one came to oppoſe him in his deceit, ſaid, <hi>It were fitter ſuch an idle huſwife were whipt, and ſent to Bridewell. Paul</hi> vvent into the Temple and Synagogues, to declare againſt them that held up the Idols Temple and ſhadovvs, from vvhence he vvas ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out, impriſoned, and abuſed. But <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> ſtands up in the chiefe place of the aſſembly, and Phariſee like he ſtands praying in the Idols Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſome that bear vvitneſſe againſt him, he threatneth vvith vvhips and Bridevvel; and ſome are haled out and impriſoned; for he confeſſeth, pag. 58. in the margin, that one is novv impriſoned for diſturbing him: Therefore <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Ewins</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> are not alike.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Paul</hi> vvas not ſent to baptize, <hi>but to preach the Goſpel,</hi> and to turn to the light. But <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> doth either baptize, as he calls it, that is to ſay, waſh the outſide of the people in brooks and rivers, when the inſide is full of hypocriſie, deceit and wickedneſs, not being ſent, or elſe he was ſent to do it, and from the light doth hee turn. And of that Goſpel is he no Preacher, therefore no preacher of that Goſpel which <hi>Paul</hi> preached.</p>
               <p>Again, it is the work of the Devil, the god of the World, to blind the minds of thoſe that belive not in the light, leſt the light of the glorious Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Chriſt ſhould ſhine unto them, and into their hearts, to give the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the glory of God. And <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> is no Preacher of the light, but leſt the light which God commanded to ſhine out of darkneſs, ſhould ſhine into peoples hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt, he labours hard to blind their minds with prejudice againſt the light, telling them, it is pernicious doctrine; they that preach it, ſhut up the Kingdom, and take people from believing in the perſon
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62941:33"/>of Chriſt. Therefore is <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> a Miniſter of Satan, and a Co-worker with the Devil, in blinding peoples minds, and turning them from the light.</p>
               <p>And now all this being conſidered, will it be unequal for me to couple him with <hi>Ralph Farmer,</hi> though he would couple me with him, and ſay, he wondred that I and they, who are ſo different in other things, can all agree to caſt ſtones at him; which is a lye, for I joined not with <hi>Ralph Farmer,</hi> to caſt ſtones at him, whoſe blood-thirſty ſpirit I do deny, and with it have I no uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but in ſoberneſs and ſeriouſneſs I write the truth concerning him. But he asketh me if I be not joined a brother in bitterneſs with him, that is to ſay, <hi>R. F.</hi> I anſwer, nay, I am no brother in bitterneſs with him, but all brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and affinity with that bitter, envious, bloody, perſecuting ſpirit, with which ye both are acted and ruled, I do utterly renounce and diſclaim, who in my meaſure have unity with that meek and gentle ſpirit, which with God is of great price, and therefore hated and perſecuted by Satans inſtruments; but I perceive there is ſomething in what I writ, that hath diſcovered his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, and he is much hurt, that his works of darkneſs are laid open. Surely there is an arrow that hath reacht the heart of the Kings enemie, he ſaith I writ a Letter to him, about a year ago, and now publiſhed it to the world in ſuch a ſubtile manner, as that he who reads my title page, would verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he were ſome dreadful Perſecutor. Alas poor man! how is he handled and troubled that his works of darkneſs are made manifeſt, and his skirts diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered? Oh! Had the deceit been hid, and the wicked perſecuting ſpirit been covered, he would have born it; but to have it publiſhed, that Paſſers by behold and take notice of it, this he likes not, but is ſorely troubled and wounded at it. And did he not, on this conſideration, leſt deceit ſhould be made manifeſt, conceal the anſwers to the Antiquaeries, but ſuffered them to be printed long time after he received the anſwers, as if no anſwer at all had been given to them. Poor blind man! he is of a large principle, and can bear with thoſe that think vain traditions ſufficient, and not differ from thoſe that are thorough paced in other things. But to be plainly and truly dealt withal, to have the deeds of darkneſs reproved and manifeſted not to daub, not to ſow pillows, not to cry peace to them that go on in their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. But to reprove ſharply, to lay open the skirts of the Whore, to cry aloud, and not to ſpare, but declare againſt tranſgreſſion and ſin, and to reprove it in the gate. O this is accompted harſh, the falſe Prophet cannot endure it, it diſturbs his peace. This with him is not modeſt, but <hi>Ralph Farmer,</hi> who he confeſſeth, jerks, jeers, quibbles, and ſcoffs, and utters ſuch words, as he look upon to be the fruits of a frothy brain, and the product of a ſpleeniſh temper, which he ſaith, might better become the mouth of a Stage-player, then the pen of a Miniſter, is more modeſt then I. But how ſo? Why he doth not name me, one may read his words, and yet not know whom he mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; but ſaith he, you have named me, ye have laid me open, ye have publiſhed only name in your Frontiſpiece, which whoſo reads, will think I a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> a Perſecutor. Oh! how is he troubled at this, that deceit and wickedneſſe, ſhould be brought to day-light, and that they that go about to hide their work in the dark, ſhould be laid open. And this was the condition of his generation all along, they could not endure to have their deeds diſcovered; and therefore it was that the ſervants of God, who were ſent to bear witneſs againſt them, found ſuch hard and cruel mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62941:33"/>which he is now filling up, who have all one purſe, he hath caſt in his lot amongſt them, and if his councel be taken, one muſt to the whip, and another to the priſon, as he ſaith, for diſturbing him, and hath publiſhed it to his own ſhame, and what diſturbs him he hath manifeſted; but is not he an evil doer that hates the light, and will not bring his deeds to it to be tryed, leaſt the light ſhould reprove him, but he is no Preacher of the light. To which I ſay, the day hath manifeſted him and others, and no veil nor deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful covering, can any longer hide them from the manifeſtation of the light, though they can bear with one another, even in thoſe things which his own words beſpeak quite contrary, and not differ, yet they who fear the Lord, cannot join with you, but; as the Lord calls them to it, muſt bear witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you all, and the Lord is now gathering his people from amongſt you, and he is your friend, that deals plainly with you, and tells you the truth, though ye may account me your enemy for ſo doing, and ſay I have acted like <hi>Judas.</hi> But what have I done? Why, publiſhed your deceit openly, and diſcovered the skirts of the Whore, and now her children beſtir them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover her veil, but all in vain, for all your veils of deceit muſt be pluckt off and naked muſt ye be, and open rebuke is better then ſecret love; and thoſe that deal uprightly cannot cry peace to the wicked.

But ſaith <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Ewins,</hi> I did it but once, upon which you conclude, I am no Miniſter of the Goſpel, but a perſecutor of the truth. I anſwer. And well I may, for he that is a perſecutor of the truth, is no Preacher of the Goſpel; and he that luſts after a thing, hath committed the thing in his heart, and out of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh; and a clear fountain ſendeth not forth ſuch filthy ſtuff, but by ſuch fruits is the devouring wolfe known. And for that, that he pleads it was but once; I ſay, <hi>Cain</hi> killed his brother but once, <hi>Herod</hi> ſlew the innocent children but once, and <hi>Judas</hi> betrayed his Maſter
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62941:34"/>but once, and yet ſin did ſo lye at their doors, that the juſt judgements and vengeance of the Lord, they could not eſcape.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Ralph Farmer</hi> ſpeaks and writes againſt thoſe people called <hi>Quakers,</hi> whom he revile, ſlanders, and belies, and ſeeks occaſion to ſpeak evil of them, as was the manner of blood-thirſty perſecutors; and <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> helps on with his ſtrength, and ſo doth his company. And ſomething it was, that he confeſſeth <hi>Ralph Farmer</hi> gave him the right hand of fellowſhip, and was ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in his call. By all which, and much more that might be ſaid, it is manifeſt that one and the ſelf ſame ſpirit guides them both, onely one hath a larger meaſure, and the other a ſtraighter, about which they need not differ. But however, as <hi>Pilate</hi> and <hi>Herod,</hi> in ſome things they do diſagree, and are at odds, yet in one are they joyned againſt the Lamb, who is the light, of which the ſervants of God do bear witneſs; and although their light hit not in every thing, yet are they joyned hand in hand againſt the true light; and although <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> in word hath denied himſelf a Pariſh Miniſter, yet by his fruits is he manifeſted to be amongſt them, and of the ſame ſpirit with them, and the day hath diſcovered him, and ſufficiently is he proved in confuſion; and truly your covering is the Lord ripping off, and your skirts are diſcovered, and the mingled people in the midſt of <hi>Babylon,</hi> where are ſome misbaptized people, wanting light, to ſee right adminiſtrations, but think their Infant-baptiſm ſufficient. Others are thorough-paced Anabaptiſts, ſome walking in ſtraight principles, others in large, one thinking one thing, and another an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and yet you differ not. Now is not this child like the mother, and will not ſuch a ſon help to recover the veil, to cover his mothers skirts, that ye may all bear with one another in darkneſs, that your works may be hid? but the Lords wayes are not yours, and therefore muſt your skirts be laid open, and your heels made bare, for the year of the redeemed is come, and the glory of the Lord is ariſen upon his people, as in dayes of old. Therefore muſt <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> where the darkneſs and confuſion is, be troubled and recompenced; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which your lot is now fall'n.</p>
               <p>And for the anſwers to the 16. quaeries which I publiſhed, and he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I own them, and not a word therein hath he diſproved, but tells me he might commend my wit in putting them forth after the man is dead. To which I ſay, its like he writes one thing, and thinks another, which with him may be an uſual practice. But how can I commend his honeſt dealing, upon a juſt ground, who had the anſwers delivered to him in writing, ſome moneths before the quaeries were publiſhed. And was that honeſt or commendable for him, to be the conveyer of 16. Antiquaeries to me, and in ſhort time received an anſwer from thoſe to whom the Antiquaeries were directed, and either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal them himſelf from <hi>John Pendarvis,</hi> or elſe he neglect to take notice thereof, and in his book ſeveral moneths after, publiſhed the ſaid Antiquaeries by the name of quaeries, as if they had never been anſwered; now if he had not printed the quaeries, or printing them, had alſo printed the anſwers, and ſo had replyed thereto; or, if they could have diſproved them, it had been ſomething like men, but to print the one, and conceal the other, is ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely foul and deceitful, that it was the cauſe of publiſhing thoſe anſwers, that he with all that were concerned in that deceit, might be manifeſted. And if <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> will clear his fellow which is dead, he may, and then his own hypocriſie will the more appear. And whereas he confeſſeth thoſe quaeries

               <p>I ſay, wherein do the anſwers differ, or how doth it appear that they agree not, for he manifeſts nothing of it: And ſince he could manifeſt nothing, why doth he give his tongue and his pen to ſlandering? But doth one anſwer build up that which another throws downe? or doth one confeſſe that which ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther denies? It's true, one anſwer may be larger then another, and good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fon, for there was ſomething in the Antiquaeries, which was leſt out, when they were printed by the name of Quaeries; and was not that a difference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, one while to ſend them by the name of Antiquaeries, and after they were ſo anſwered, to print them by the name of Quaeries. Beſides, did <hi>Matthew, Marke, Luke,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> differ, and not agree? and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveable by him, becauſe of the thing of which they all declare, they uſe not one and the ſelf-ſame words, and no more, but one is larger in his Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration then another: And whereas he ſeemeth to compare the Antiquaeries to the Scripture, and the anſwers to the meaning or interpretation the Prieſt put thereon, I ſay, his compariſon will not hold; for the Antiquaeries, in which were lyes and deceit, are not to be compared to the Scriptures of truth: And if he be not wilfully blinde and ignorant, he may ſee his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and his companions, who are of differing principles, as much as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt ſtreight and broad, and yet, ſaith he, we differ not; and yet himſelfe would ſlander others in ſecret for differing, but no wayes makes it appeare wherein. And ſo in this, as well as in other of his works, hath he manifeſted his owne folly, and all the ſaid anſwers ſtand uncontrolled by him in the leaſt.</p>

               <p>And how well might he ſave his labour in many pages, in which he ſo vainly boaſts and commends himſelfe for a Preacher and publiſher of the glorious Goſpel, that needs no proof of man, &amp;c. And the many hundreds that can ſay, the Lord is with his Miniſtry, &amp;c. I ſay, how well might he be ſilent in this his own commendations, who preſently gives it under his hand, that he much queſtions whether he hath received the Spirit of the New Teſtament, to open and reveal the myſteries of the Kingdome, which to the Saints is given to know. For that Goſpel which the Miniſters of Chriſt did, and do preach, and is indeed glorious, is the Goſpel of the Kingdom, and that Goſpel was and is a myſtery hid from ages and generations, but was and is manifeſted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to them by the Spirit; which Spirit he having not received, the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Kingdome, and of the Goſpel thereof, to him are not opened, but are hid, as it was from ages and generations paſt. And then (poor man!) what hath he to preach, or to miniſter; or with what can he quicken, comfort and refreſh poor ſouls, and turn them to God, as he ſpeaks? Well may he feed them with aſhes, winde and confuſion, with lying viſions, with a viſion of his own heart. And by a ſpirit of <hi>Divination,</hi> may he cauſe them to erre from the right way like <hi>Balaam.</hi> But with the bread of life, the immortall food, the power of God, the life and quickning of the Spirit, the hidden myſteries of the Goſpel, in which the glory of God is manifeſted, he is not intruſted, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62941:36"/>of it can he at all miniſter, to whom it is hid, and not opened, nor reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And are not all thoſe blinde, and like to fall into the ditch, that are led by ſuch a guide? expecting to receive joy, peace, eſtabliſhment, comfort, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment from him, who is out of it all, can do nothing vvell, but is dry, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren and empty, in the pollution and defilement, not purged, cleanſed, nor ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, nor adorned with ſpirituall gifts, but is himſelfe out of it all, and gives it under his hand that it is ſo? And how dares he ſay, his record is on high, and that many ſoules that lay weltring in their blood of ignorance before he came, are now turned to God: For although the children of the night, and of darkneſſe may flatter, and pleaſe themſelves in their imaginations and lying vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, yet how can he be an inſtrument to turn ſouls to God, who (himſelfe) is out of all (&amp;c. as is before mentioned) and can do nothing well, nor knows that God, to whom he pretends to turn ſouls, <hi>for God is light, and in him is no darkneſſe at all;</hi> and thoſe that turn ſouls to God, turn them to the light, for God is light, but of this is he no Preacher, but accounts it pernicious doctrine to bid people turn to the light.</p>
               <p>And whereas he ſaith (page 59.) it is his daily care and work to preach the Kingdome of God freely to ſinners, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt as the vvay to the Kingdome, and to invite and encourage poor ſoules to come into it, I ſay, his ignorance both of the Kingdome of God, and of Chriſt the light which is the way, is ſeen and comprehended: <hi>For the Kingdome of God cometh not with obſervation,</hi> but ſaith Chriſt (who is the true light, and the vvay to the Kingdome) <hi>the Kingdome of God is within you,</hi> and in his Kingdome he is, vvho is light; and he that is the vvay, and the truth, the ſame is the light, <hi>that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightneth every man that cometh into the world:</hi> And all that are invited and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to come into the Kingdome, are invited and encouraged to come into it vvhere it is, and that is <hi>within,</hi> and not in outvvard obſervations; and thoſe that are encouraged to vvalk in the vvay that leadeth into the Kingdom, are encouraged to receive and vvalk in the light, vvhich is the vvay, Chriſt Jeſus, the light of the vvorld; and ſo all that preach the Kingdome of God, preach it vvithin, and all that ever preached Chriſt, the vvay to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, preached the light, for he is the true light. But againſt all this hath <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> declared, not only his ignorance, but alſo his enmity, and ſaith, to bid people turn to the light vvithin, is pernicious Doctrine, of it is he no Preacher, and thoſe that preach this Doctrine, do ſhut up the Kingdome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt themſelves and others. Alas, poor blinde man! vvhat a pittiful thing (of a Preacher) is he, vvhoſe eye is ſo utterly darkned and made blinde, by the god of the World, to vvhom he turns, or vvith vvhom he keeps multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of ſouls, that novv the day is ſo much appeared, he cannot ſee, but is groping as in the night, vvearying himſelf in his imaginations, ſtumbling at the light, which is his condemnation; but the glory of Gods <hi>Iſrael,</hi> vvho receive, and believe in the ſame.</p>
               <p>And whereas he ſaith, he preacheth that Goſpel of glad tydings, which Chriſt gave Commandment to be preached to all Nations, in which the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting love and good Will of God in Chriſt is declared to loſt ſinners, I ſay, that Goſpel, of which the Apoſtles of Chriſt were not aſhamed, is the power of God to ſalvation, to all that receive his love, and believe in the light; but againſt all that walk after the fleſh, according to the courſe of this world, in the imaginations of their hearts, not believing in the light, nor to it are
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62941:36"/>obedient, but hold the truth of God in unrighteouſneſs, the wrath of God is revealed, and thorough the Goſpel which is the power of God, is tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and anguiſh miniſtred to every ſoul that doth evil, and againſt all ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men, and the Goſpel of the grace of God teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to deny it, which Goſpel according to the Commandement of Chriſt, is now preached, not onely thoroughout this Nation of <hi>England,</hi> and the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof, but in moſt or all other Nations, I know in the world; ſo that the chief Cities and Seats of the Pope and Turk are not exempted; and the Miniſters thereof have not loved their lives unto the death, nor accompted any thing too dear, or too much to ſuffer, ſo they may but finiſh their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and the Miniſtry which by God is committed to them for the Elects ſake, and from other Heathens do they receive the like meaſure abroad, as they do from their own Country-men at home, and account it not grievous to ſuffer for the name of Jeſus, whilſt the Miniſters of Satan that work deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, deſtroying ſouls for diſhoneſt gain, are at eaſe in their wealthy Pariſhes and Lectures, living in pleaſure and idleneſs, not ſerving the Lord, but their own bellies, and by pleaſing words deceive the ſouls of the ſimple, ſpeaking evil of that they underſtand not, perſecuting the truth, and evilly entreating the Meſſengers thereof, for which they muſt give an accompt.</p>
               <p>And for what he ſpeaks of <hi>Mary Prince</hi> (which he calls Mrs. <hi>Prince</hi>) accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her of envy, hypocriſie, railing, reproaching, jeering, ſcoffing, &amp;c. I ſay, Alas! poor man, why had he not firſt pulled the beam out of his own eye, before he had ſought motes in anothers eye; for, <hi>Mary Prince,</hi> for many years paſt hath had, and ſtill hath ſo large a witneſs, not onely in his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, but in the conſciences of many other her enemies, of her meek, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and good converſation, beyond many, which he himſelf accompts the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, that I need not ſay a word in her behalf, but let wickedneſs be upon the head of the wicked and falſe accuſer.</p>
               <p>But for what is ſhe accuſed (as aforeſaid?) why, for this, namely bearing true teſtimony againſt his deceit, and (as he ſaith) called to the people at his Lecture, and bid them beware of him, for ſhe had heard him ſay, that he had not the Spirit of God. To which I ſay, I never read of any of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt that were owners of a thing called a Lecture, but why doth he call it his Lecture, but becauſe for hire he preacheth it, and ſo the hire of about 24 <abbr>l.</abbr> a year, being his, he calls it his Lecture? But was it not good counſel ſhe gave the people? namely, to beware of him, that by him they might not be deceived. Let the Reader, but conſider and juſtly weigh what himſelf gives forth, from pag. 51. to pag. 55. and he may eaſily ſee how need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and neceſſary it was, for her that knew him well, to give ſuch warning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereunto moved; for if a man will take upon him to be a Preacher and a leader of others, who hath not received the Spirit of God, to open and reveal the myſteries of the kingdom of God, nor to comfort &amp; refreſh drooping ſouls, nor to ſtrengthen and encourage them with boldneſs to do and ſuffer for God, to purge, purifie, cleanſe, ſanctifie and make them holy and fruitful, and grow in grace, and fill them with meekneſs and love, and make them ſpiritual, and unite them together, and to adorn them with ſpiritual gifts and grace; nor to fill them with a ſpirit of faith and prayer; yea, if he hath not received that ſpirit, without which he can do nothing well; how exceeding needful is it that people be warned thereof? and how great is the love of the Lord, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62941:37"/>them warning in time? for what can any ſoul receive from ſuch a blind, unholy, unſanctified Miniſtry that can do nothing well except it be by it to be led into the ditch and cauſed to wander in the dark and blind paths of deceit and deluſion towards death and deſtruction, which is your own words to the Reader. And if <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> be not the man whoſe condition this is, and hath publiſhed himſelf ſo under his own hand, let the ſober Reader judg; and ſo <hi>Mary Prince</hi> is clear of the blood of them that received not warning, and <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi> his accuſations turn heavily on his own head, but her they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach, who hath delivered her own ſoul, by giving them warning.</p>
               <p>And whereas he ſaith, I tell in my Letter, I was warned from inviſible lights to beware of him, and that by viſible light he diſcerned his ſpeaking was but little acceptable to me and others, after he began to oppoſe, though before he was the excellenteſt man that ever I met with.</p>
               <p>I ſay, what high and excellent thoughts he had of himſelf, may be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and becauſe he accounted himſelf ſo excellent, 'tis like he perſwades him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that I accounted him ſo too, in which he is miſtaken; for, I was ſo far from it, that himſelf declares that his ſpeaking had ſo little acceptation with me and others, that we were obſerved often to go out of the meeting when he was to ſpeak, which is an abſolute lye too, though by reaſon of his flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, daubing and deceit, there might be cauſe enough, and grief it is to ſee men of corrupt minds to oppoſe the truth. And for ſeveral years, his preaching and devining, to me appeared ſo dry and empty, like other of the worlds Teachers, that is was truly a grief and burthen to me to ſit under it. And for what he ſpeaks of my ſaying I was warned from inviſible lights to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of him, it is a viſible lye, in which he is too much exerciſed, and no ſuch word was publiſhed by me, but that I was long ſince warned from invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſights or manifeſtations, to beware of him is true; ſomething of whoſe woful condition was then manifeſted, and may be accompliſhed, towards which he haſtens apace. But his enmity and hatred againſt the light, (which is the glory of Gods Iſrael is ſuch) that he cannot but belye it. And to him I ſay, that which God hath prepared before the face of all people, a light to lighten the Gentiles, hath diſcovered and manifeſted him no Preacher, nor Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of Chriſt, but a perſecutor of the life and power of God. And in the day of his diſtreſs and anguiſh, which is coming from afar, in which the men of war ſhall not find their hands, but weep bitterly, in which the ſtrong ſhall be as tow, and all hands be weak, and all knees be feeble, and all faces ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paleneſs, in which our God ſhall roar out of <hi>Sion,</hi> and utter his terrible voice from his holy Temple, before which all the earth ſhall tremble, in which the Lords ſalvation ſhall be manifeſted for his people, in the deſtruction of all his enemies; I ſay, in that day, which is at hand, and as a deſtruction from the Almighty cometh, ſhall he ſee and know that by the ſame ſpirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, which was of old, in the Prophets and holy men, and promiſed in this day to be poured out upon ſons and daughters, is hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And that it is not for nought, that the Lord hath ſent his ſervants, in his dread and power to warn the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though they turn not from their wicked wayes. And alſo that it is not for nought that thoſe ſervants of the Lord, that ſtands in his counſel and receive his will (from whom God hides not the things he is about to do in the world) have not loved their lives unto the death, but given their backs to the ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62941:37"/>and their cheeks to them that pull of the hair, nor hid themſelves from ſhame and ſuffering, for their reward is before them, and their God is with them, whoſe acceptable day to them is manifeſted, though the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee it, glory to his name for evermore.</p>
               <p>And whereas he tells of his ſucceſs and proſperouſneſs in his work, and the large room he hath got in the peoples hearts ſince I left him, and the uſe he is of to the deſolate Church.</p>

And indeed you are plainly manifeſt to be not onely out of the power of godlineſſe, but alſo out of the true forme in which the Saints were. One ſort following your ſtrait princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and another your large, till ye become drunk in your imaginations, and have quite loſt the right way, ſetting up your own inventions, which the Lord our light and life is come to diſcover, deſtroy and confound, glory and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to his name for evermore: And with thy flattering ſeverall perſons that little regard thee, and the badneſſe of thy ſpirit therein appearing, I ſhall not meddle, nor yet declare how much thou conteſt under the black ſpirit of <hi>Ralph Farmer.</hi> But as brethren in wickedneſſe and lying I ſhall leave you together.</p>
               <p>Onely I muſt a little correct <hi>Ralph Farmer,</hi> whoſe book entituled <hi>The Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor dethroned,</hi> &amp;c. I have ſeen, and part thereof have read, and finde it ſo like the former, that a man might wonder how you that differ ſo much in ſome things, (being in your ſtreight and large principles, and various lights) ſhould agree ſo well in the works of darkneſs to oppoſe the true light, but that ye all having given heed to the ſame lying ſpirit, in your diſtempered humorous bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, are by it led in the ſelf-ſame way of lying, deceit and wickedneſs, which is the Devils work. And although I am not willing to trouble my ſelfe much with the filthy ſpirit of that worthleſſe man, nor to take into the loathſome channell of his monſtrous birth. Yet ſeeing how abhominably filthy, wicked,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62941:38"/>and impudent he is in the buſineſſe of <hi>Conſtant Jeſſops</hi> removing out of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh of <hi>Nicholas,</hi> in which I know he was a chief Actor or Sollicitor; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding by ſhameleſs lying in his foreſaid book, he labours to cover his deceit, and excuſe himſelfe, I cannot let it paſſe; but (for the information of all thoſe that are concerned therein, who can believe and receive truth, and for the manifeſting the wofull deceit, and falſe-heartedneſs of this loathſom man) declare, that notwithſtanding he there affirmes, that all he ſpake to me of that buſineſs was, that the oppoſition in publique was not fit to be ſuffered to hinder a ſettlement, and to alienate mens affections, &amp;c. And that this was occaſional by his coming to my houſe, and ſtaying for the coming in of Mr. <hi>Cradock</hi> (as he called him) who (he was informed) lodged there, and that what he ſpake had reſpect to another brother as well as to Mr. <hi>Jeſſop,</hi> he ſaith, of whoſe caſting out he did not know, nor had any hand in one way or other, by writing, ſpeaking, or ſuggeſtion to any perſon whatſoever; and that outing and baniſhing from the City was ſo far from his expectation, and ſeemed to him ſo rigorous, that he publiquely taxed and declared againſt it, and that he never ſpake with me at any time after that occaſionall diſcourſe aforeſaid, which ſaith he, was before Mr. <hi>Jeſſop</hi> preached that Sermon, for which he was caſt out: And that he never uſed that argument to me, that till Mr. <hi>Jeſſop</hi> was removed the City would not be in quiet, &amp;c. Yet after <hi>Conſtant Jeſſop</hi> had preached that Sermon for which he was caſt out, and after the Committee (of which I was a member) had queſtioned the ſame; and after the buſineſſe had there lyen ſtill a while, and little or nothing done in it, by reaſon of his many friends therein that pleaded his excuſe, did <hi>Ralph Farmer</hi> come to my houſe, and (after his wonted complement ſet his back againſt my Cheſt, and looking hard upon me, ſaid to this effect, Mr. <hi>Holliſter,</hi> what do you intend to do? To which I replying to this effect, what do I intend to do; why? what's the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? why (ſaid he) about Mr. <hi>Jeſſop:</hi> To which I replying to this effect, what have I to do with Mr. <hi>Jeſſop?</hi> he ſaid he heard I lay ſtill, and did not proſecute him, or words to that purpoſe. To which I replying that I was no proſecutor of him, neither did I hear him. But if any man had ought whereof to accuſe him, and brought it before the Committee when I was preſent, it was like I might do what was juſt, or as became me, or to that effect. With which he not being pleaſed, uſed many words to provoke and ſtir me up againſt <hi>Conſtant Jeſſop,</hi> and at length, ſomething paſſionately or zealouſly ſaid theſe very words (or to the ſame effect) Mr. <hi>Holliſter,</hi> I ſhall ſeriouſly tell you my judgement: If you neglect to take the advantage of this preſent opportunity for caſting him out, I profeſs we are never like to have peace nor quiet in the City: And in many other words declared againſt his Presbyterian ſpirit, and the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it, and ſpake of his ſubtilty, by reaſon whereof another opportunity might not be gained, if this was loſt, with much more of like nature: So that I may truly ſay, that to my knowledge, I was not ſo much, nor ſo earneſtly preſt and ſollicited by any other man whatſoever againſt <hi>Conſtant Jeſſop,</hi> as I was by this falſ hearted and deceitfull man, though he is ſo impudent and void of ſhame to deny it, and publiſh it as aforeſaid. And I ſay again, all this was after <hi>Conſtant Jeſſop</hi> had preached that Sermon for which he was caſt out, and not before, as he falſly pretends, neither do I know nor can believe he had any other buſineſs in the world to me, at that time, but only to endeavour to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke and ſtir me up againſt his brother, that he might be caſt out: And that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62941:38"/>what he ſpeaks of his coming and ſtaying for <hi>Walter Cradock,</hi> is abſolutely falſe; for in many years together he lodged not at my houſe, but at the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, and elſe-where. Neither can I remember or do think that at that time he ſpake a word to me againſt any other of his brethren beſides <hi>Conſtant Jeſſop,</hi> againſt whom his ſole buſineſſe was, thinking him not proſecuted vigrouſly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. And of this his coming to my houſe, and ſpeaking as aforeſaid, or to the ſame effect, other ſufficient teſtimony that then were preſent, and heard, and obſerved it may be produced: And what I have ſaid, is true in ſubſtance, and (as near as I can remember) in words and ſyllables. And it's true, that when the effect of his own ſolicitation vvas accompliſhed in his brothers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, (I was informed) before the people he declared againſt it, as if he vvere innocent, and had been no actor againſt him, vvhich to me appeared ſo loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome a piece of hypocriſie, deceit, and double-dealing, that I durſt never truſt him ſince, but have declared againſt him, and to ſeverall of his acquaintance manifeſted much of the ſubſtance of what is here publiſhed.</p>
               <p>But whether <hi>Ralph Farmer</hi> knowing himſelfe (in compariſon of <hi>Conſtant Jeſſop</hi>) ſo inconſiderable, that till he was removed, himſelfe had no hopes of preferment by that generation, did more ſecretly endeavour his caſting out, and when it was done, declared againſt it, that he might not be ſuſpected by his friends and people; but with the more eaſe might obtain his place, I ſhall not determine, but leave it to the witneſſe of God to manifeſt, though time hath pretty well manifeſted him, to all that are not blinde. And ſo far was it ſeen before, that <hi>Conſtant Jeſſop</hi> himſelfe before he was caſt out; being in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with ſome of the Pariſh, and ſpeaking of the buſineſſe in hand, told them he feared that his place would be farmed over his head, meaning (as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt himſelfe) that <hi>Farmer</hi> would get it from him. And of this his friend <hi>Thomas Bub</hi> (among others) may inform him; and all this I ſuppoſe was about the time, in which (he tells the world) ſome of our powers were ſo great, that the life and death of mens preferments lay in our hands: And ſo it's like, for preferment, ſake he did it, for which alſo, whiles he thought our power ſo great, he had a minde to be one with us then called <hi>Independents:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at another time applyed himſelfe to me, telling me he was convinced of the neceſſity of being in a Church-way, and propounded his deſire both for himſelfe and his people (which to himſelfe he had gathered) to joyne with us, and make but one Church, provided, as he ſaid, that we would conſent to the compleating it with officers, in which he ſpake ſo much that I perceived he ſought for preferment among us, after which he had laboured elſe-where in vain, And therefore told him how vain it was for him to effect ſuch a thing from us, who (I thought) vvere ſo far from it, that before he could be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a member, ſatisfaction would be required touching his leaving a Church (ſo called) in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> &amp;c. By which (its like) he ſaw ſuch little hopes of preferment for him, through my hands, that I heard no more of him about the buſineſs. But having obtained the end of his ſollicitation, in his brothers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, he applyes himſelfe both to his place and people; and when, by the change of times, vile men were exalted, he rode over both, and conquered it as his own, and now calls it his, and ſo is become a blinde guide to thoſe call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and an enraged enemy to thoſe with whom under a cloak of Religion, for the ſake of preferment, he aſſayed to joyn, whiles as he ſaith, the life and death of it lay in their hands. But, ſaith he, one of the Congregation
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62941:39"/>told him, if he would be one of the Congregation, he might be choſen Paſtor, and that ſhe was told, if he might be choſen Paſtor, he would joyn with them, which it's like, made the man very confident of the buſineſs, and was the end of his foreſaid propoſition to me, notwithſtandinng all his feigned deceitfull pretences to the contrary, a thing ſo common and uſual with that generation of hirelings, that who is it that may not ſee it. But were they not wofully blinde that could entertain the leaſt thought of chooſing ſo pittifull a piece of ignorance, confuſion &amp; ambition, as <hi>Ralph Farmer,</hi> to be their guide, who had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proclaimed himſelf not able to preach for want of Books? &amp; told the people he could but expound till they came: And was it not my croſſing of him in his ambitious thoughts, and deſires, that filled his heart vvith poyſon and rage, vvhich he poureth forth in ſo many corners, though in neither of his books hath he found vvherevvith to hit me. But all his lyes, ſlanders, and falſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations, being as light as vanity, and not vvorth the mentioning, do I trample upon. And ſurely woe were me, if ſuch a man as he (a worſe than which is rarely found) ſpake well of me.</p>
               <p>But why doth he ſo much reproach, belye, and abuſe me for being a member of the little Parliament? Doth he not know how honourably <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> declared them in his ſpeech in the Councel Chamber? And why is he ſo envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that my ſelf, with others were ſo truly ſerviceable there to our generation, <hi>according to the will of God,</hi> with our Bibles in our hands, and were willing to ſpend and be ſpent in the ſervice of our Countrey, not ſeeking our ſelves, but the eaſe and profit of the people? and did not, like other Governours, <hi>eate the bread of the people, nor were at all chargeable unto them,</hi> read <hi>Neh.</hi> 5.14, 15. For he might know, that <hi>the memory of the juſt will be bleſſed.</hi> when <hi>the name of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> (hireling Prieſthood) <hi>ſhall rot:</hi> For a ſpirit of Juſtice and Government was God powring ſorth upon that Aſſembly, which made unclean ſpirits, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring beaſts that live upon the prey and ſpoyl of others, to tremble; of which he, its like, was not unſenſible; And had they ſate but a little longer, it's like the Land had been cleanſed of ſuch, and the people delivered from many ſore and heavy yokes of bondage and ſlavery under which they have been held for ages and generations paſt, by Popes, Biſhops, proud domineer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prieſts, and other Tyrants; and <hi>England</hi> had known a day, in which there had not been a Diviner, a falſe Trophet, a pariſh Prieſt, a Hireling Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, a cruell Beaſt, a devouring Wolfe, nor an unclean ſpirit left in the Land, guarded with a law, to deſtroy ſouls for diſhoneſt gain, to rob the poor, the widow, and the fatherleſſe, and fill the priſons with innocent men, as they do at this day. But a howling of the Shepheards had been heard, whoſe pride and glory had been ſpoyled, and a year of rejoycing to the people had it been, in which no devouring beaſt had been permitted to live by the ſweat of their brows, not to devour the fruit of their labours; but every man in quietneſſe &amp; peace preſerved under his onw Vine and Fig-tree to fit, without feare of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoning their perſons, and ruinating their families, and eſtates, to ſatisfie the beaſtly luſt of the devouring Prieſts, who like greedy Dogs can never have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. But to the everlaſting ſhame of their profeſſion to all generations for ever, have occaſioned more juſt and innocent men to ſuffer, and to be caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to priſons, and holes, for not ſatisfying their filthy deſires, than is by all the reſt of the Pariſh beſides. To whom be it known, that though <hi>Joſeph;</hi> liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and priviledges, by the unrighteous are betrayed, and he through envy be

               <p>But why is he like the troubled Sea that cannot reſt, but caſts up his mire and dirt at me in particular, as a member of that Aſſembly, he might know I did not there baſely ſeek my ſelf, like the men of his generation, with the receipt of many thouſands of pounds, as the Parliament records make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; neither was I baſely ſervile to the wills and luſts of men, for prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſake, neither by fear nor flattery, love not hatred, ſavour nor frowns, nor any other baſe ends whatſoever, was I prevailed upon, to betray the cauſe of God, and ſell my Countreys birth right and priviledges for nought, nor to enſlave my Countrey-men and poſterity for ever, to the arbitrary wills and luſts of any, but as an Engliſh Parliament man did I ſtand, for the juſt rights and priviledges of the people, and a teſtimony for them did bear againſt the tyranny and oppreſſions of Prieſts, Rulers and other Tyrants, and that abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable monſter of conſolidation (to the wrong and oppreſſion of the people, and the breach of the priviledges and Charter of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> to fill the purſes, and ſatisfie the luſts of <hi>Ralph Farmer</hi> and <hi>John Knowles,</hi> whoſe hire already, its like, exceeds the Biſhops in come) I did not promote.</p>
               <p>And why doth he ſo wickedly accuſe me of pride and ſtrutting, like <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar,</hi> in an Airy Kingdom, foming out the ſhameful filth, of his polluted heart, thinking to defile me with his lyes and ſlanders. But that the fool hath ſaid in his heart, that there is no God, and being corrupt doth do abhominably, and ſaith, God ſeeth it not, for he that takes the mighty from their ſeats, and reſiſts the proud, ſetting them at a diſtance, hath reſpect to the humble, and exalteth them of low degree. And is it not known I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſought nor deſired great things, nor places for my ſelf, but free to ſerve my generation, in place accounted by men leaſt honourable, and was ſorely grieved when tydings came, that I was choſen to ſit in Parliament; and truly may I ſay, in more then an ordinary croſs I went. But the Scripture words were heavy upon me, <hi>viz. Thou therefore, ariſe and go, leſt I confound thee,</hi> for I did not know the Lords end in chuſing me. And hath not this accuſer heard, how, in the Parliament Houſe I withſtood and oppoſed my own Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Councel of State, and the Commiſſion of the Admiralty and Navy, when by the then General and his Councel I was nominated and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to the Houſe as a fit perſon to be added thereunto, and notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding I was contrary to my own mind voted into thoſe and other places of power and truſt; yet when in them I came to ſit, I was ſo exceedingly bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened with thoſe great titles and ſeeming honours which were there given, that both in the Councel of State, and other places, I was made to deny and declare againſt it, as not fit for thoſe that fear the Lord, &amp;c. And doth not he know that although I have long time been in Commiſſion of the Peace and other powers, ſo that himſelf hath publiſhed that the life and death of mens preferments lay in my hands (for few or none beſides of thoſe, of whom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62941:40"/>have I laid down theſe things, that with the Saints and people of God, who follow the Lamb, I might for a time ſuffer afflictions and reproaches from him and others, whoſe portion is in this life, rather then to ſit upon Throns with Princes of the earth? And why then is he not aſhamed ſo baſely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and belye the innocent, but that (as I ſaid) the fool hath ſaid in his heart, there is no God? But why had he not lookt at home, and among the proud men of his own generation, whom pride compaſſeth as a chain, and violence takes hold as a garment, who compaſs Sea and Land for preferment ſake, and know how to turn into all formes and ſhapes (true honeſty excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) to obtain thoſe titles and ſhews of honour, which the people of God, by faith refuſe, and when they have obtained it, be-pride themſelves in their Airy Kingdom, vapouring like fooliſh boyes, to the ſhame and wonder of thoſe that are ſober and wiſe, and the mighty pride of his own heart, as well as his envy, covetouſneſs, wrath and fooliſh madneſs, is ſo much manifeſted by himſelf, and ſeen, obſerved and judged by the men of his own generation, that I need ſay no more, nor yet declare how proud and Lordly he is become, ſince by wicked art he got <hi>Conſtant Jeſſop</hi> removed, and himſelf poſſeſſor of his place and people, with the advantages thereof, that like <hi>Haman,</hi> all muſt bow to his Lordly ſpirit, or ſuffer, if he can accompliſh it. Nor yet tell what a ſtir he keeps againſt Independents, Anabaptiſts and others, that go from their Pariſhes and hear not him, and in the behalf of his Office and Miniſtry, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for double honour, for the lawfulneſs of forms of prayers (its like he wants a ſervice book) for keeping off Hats, whilſt he reads the Scriptures, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling thoſe that honour him not, (not conſidering that the time is come, in which the Scripture muſt be fulfilled, viz. a vile perſon ſhall not be called honourable, nor the churl ſaid to be bountiful.) All which with much more ſilly ſtuff, in which he is exerciſed, together with his pettiſh, paſsionate, and unman-like behaviour, is ſo well known and manifeſted, that what Boy or Girl of ordinary underſtanding, is there that ſees it not? So that with <hi>Thomas Ewins</hi>'s words to him I may conclude, that the in-let and out-let, fore-door and back-door, of much of <hi>Englands</hi> miſeries (and conſequently of <hi>Briſtols</hi>) is ſuch an ignorant, ungodly, lazy, proud, ſcandalous, ſoul-murthering Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, who have made themſelves contemptible and baſe, in the eyes of all good men, and in the conſciences of many bad. And ſo much for <hi>Ralph Farmer;</hi> for what need I ſpend much time in manifeſting ſuch a man, who never appeared in any ſeaſon (that I know) a man fearing God, and denying himſelf, but the contrary. And to accompliſh his main ends of covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ambition, hath attempted more wayes, offices, and callings, and more wickedly turned with the times, into more forms &amp; ſhapes, then any other man I know. And when nothing appeared ſo like to effect it, as the art of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and devination, ſoon turned from ticker-making, and ſoliciting, &amp;c. to preaching. And when Independency was in honour, and the life and death of preferment (as he calls it) lay in the hands of thoſe that profeſt it, feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf as one of them; but when wickedneſs began to be exalted and not onely the power, but the form of godlineſs to loſe its credit with men, how ſoon was he turned Presbyter? and in wickedneſs excelled, acting, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and railing as aforeſaid. But when the times of refreſhing from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God appeared, and life and immortality, which for ages paſt had been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Oh, how is it that he doth not bluſh at this!

               <p>And that the evill ſpirit of envy, blood and cruelty in the Chief Prieſt and Elders, may the more fully appear: The Warrant for apprehending and carrying the aforeſaid perſons to Priſon, was committed to the hands of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Bayliffs, whoſe prophaneſs and wickedneſs I need not mention, yet they being conſcious of the honeſty of their priſoners, promiſed them liberty to go to their houſes, and order and ſettle their buſineſs, and meet them at a place appointed the next day. But having been a little abſent (its like with the Prieſt or Elders, or ſome of their evill generation) their minds were changed, and cruelty raiſed, ſo that with much harſhneſſe and threatning they carryed them away, not ſuffering them to go to their houſes to exchange their cloaths, nor abide where they were till their ſervants brought them. But <hi>Richard Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſters</hi> ſervant haſting after with neceſſary apparel, the greateſt kindneſſe he obtained, was liberty to ſhift himſelfe, and exchange his apparell under a wall or hedge, notwithſtanding the Bayliffs themſelves (when out of the view, or overſight of the Prieſt and Elders, with their perſecuting crew) offered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be bound for them, if they would accept it, profeſſing their ſhame to carry ſuch men to priſon.

               <p>And becauſe every Reader may not have the advantage of reading thoſe Books being of ſo large a volumn and price, I ſhall give a touch of what I finde therein recorded, touching the teſtimony the Martyrs did beare againſt the Prieſts Tythes, and ſwearing, referring the Reader to the Hiſtories themſelves, in vvhich he may finde it more at large.</p>
               <p>In the firſt book, pag 621. the fourth Article againſt <hi>Walter Brute,</hi> a famous Martyr, is, That he hath laboured to inform men and companies, that no man is bound to give Tythes or Oblations: And that if any man will give them, he may give them to whom he will (excluding thereby their Vicars.) And in page 622. another Article againſt him is, That Tythes are meer almes: And in caſe the Curate be evill, they may lawfully be beſtowed upon others, by the temporall owners: And in a publique inſtrument brought forth and publiſhed againſt the ſaid <hi>Brute</hi> (mentioned in page 623.) it is ſaid and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:62941:43"/>that the ſald <hi>Brute,</hi> before the Biſhop of <hi>Hereford,</hi> did ſay, hold publiquely, and affirme, that Chriſtian people are not bound to pay Tythes, neither by the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor of Chriſt: And that it is not lawful for Chriſtians in any cauſe, nor in any caſe, to ſvvear by the Creator, nor by the Creature. And in pag. 632. <hi>Walter Brute</hi> having before his perſecutors, declared againſt Tythes (manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting hovv they belong to the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> and were not promiſed to the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> out of vvhich Chriſt came. And of the change of the Law, by vvhich Tythes vvere once claimed, &amp;c.) ſaith, I marvail that you learned men do ſay, that Chriſtian folk are bound to this ſmall ceremony of payment of Tythes, &amp;c. It's plain (ſaith he) that the Tythes were given to the ſons of <hi>Levi,</hi> for their ſerving in the Tabernacle, and in the Temple of the Lord, as the firſt fruits were given to the Prieſts. And ſince the labour of thoſe ſacrifices did ceaſe at the coming of Chriſt, how ſhould theſe things be demanded, that were ordained for that labour? And ſince firſt fruits are not now demanded of Chriſtians, why are Tythes demanded, except it be becauſe Tythes are of more value and worth then firſt fruits? And beſides ſaith he, why are the Lay people bound to the payment of Tythes, more then the Prieſts from having poſſeſsons of realities and Lordſhips among their brethren? And again, ſaith he, If we be bound to Tything, we are debtors to, and bound to keep the whole Law; for, to ſay, we are bound to one Ceremony of the Law, and not to others, is no reaſonable thing; for, ſaith he, we are bound to all or to none. And ſo he goes on, ſhewing how our Prieſts were one with the Phariſees, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving off the ceremonies of the Law, keeping onely the Commandement of Tythes. And how plain it is, that Chriſt was a Prieſt after the order of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech,</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> not of <hi>Levi,</hi> and gave no new Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Tything any thing, to him and his Prieſts. And when his Diſciples ſaid, <hi>We have left all to follow thee, what ſhall we have?</hi> He did not ſay Tythes ſhall be paid you; and that ſince, neither by the Commandement of Chriſt nor his Apoſtles, people were to pay Tythes; it is (ſaith he) manifeſt and plain, that neither by the Law of Chriſt, nor of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Chriſtian people are bound to pay Tythes, but by the traditions of men, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The like teſtmony is born again Tythes, by (that valiant Martyr <hi>William Thrope,</hi> of whom the Reader may read more at large, in the foreſaid Book of Martyrs, where the largeneſs of his teſtimony, the greatneſs of his ſufferings, and the reſolution of his ſpirit for the Lord, againſt the Prieſts and Tythes, as well as ſwearing is recorded in p. 693. It appears, he was accuſed to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> by the men of <hi>Shrovesbury,</hi> for ſaying, 1. That the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament after conſecration was bread. 2. That Images ſhould in no wiſe be worſhipped 3. That men ſhould not go on pilgrimage. 4. That Prieſts have no title to Tythes. 5. That it is not lawful to ſwear in any wiſe. And in pag. 700. the Archbiſhop accuſeth him, for deeming holy Church to have erred in the Ordinance of Tythes, and other duties to be paid to Prieſts. To which <hi>Thrope</hi> anſwers, That Tythes were given to Levites and Prieſts by the old Law, that came of the linage of <hi>Levi,</hi> but our prieſts came not of that linage, and that Chriſt, all the time of his preaching lived by pure alms, and ſo did the Apoſtles by his example, or by the travel of their hands; and that every prieſt that Chriſt approveth, knows, that the Diſciple is not to be above his Lord, &amp;c. Upon which, ſaid the Archbiſhop, Gods curſe have thou, and mine, for this teaching, &amp;c. To which <hi>Thrope</hi> anſwered, in the words of one of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:62941:43"/>their Doctors, which he ſuppoſed was St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> That thoſe prieſts that now under the new Law do challenge Tythes. do in effect ſay, that Chriſt is not become man, nor ſuffered death. And alſo that (ſince Tythes were the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges limited to Levites and prieſts of the old Law, for bearing about the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, ſlaying of beaſts, and other obſervations pertaining to their Office,) thoſe prieſts that now challenge or take Tythes, deny that Chriſt is come in the fleſh, and do the office of the old Law, or elſe they take Tythes wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
               <p>Upon which the Archbiſhop ſaid, They inforce people to expugne the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of holy Church. To which <hi>Thrope</hi> anſwers, Why call ye the taking of Tythes, and other duties, that now prieſts challenge wrongfully, the freedom of holy Church? Since, neither Chriſt nor his Apoſtles challenged, nor took ſuch duties; and therefore ſaith he, all ſuch giving and taking ought to be called and holden, the ſlaverous covetouſneſs of men, &amp;c. And when the Archbiſhop demanded why he did not ſpeak againſt Lords, Knights and Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, as well as againſt prieſts, he declares, that ſince <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Prieſts are the ſtomack of the people, and ſince, by the vitiouſneſs of the Prieſts, both Lords and Commons are moſt ſinfully infected;</hi> and becauſe the pride and covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of prieſts, and the boaſt they make of their dignity and power, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes not onely the vertue of prieſthood, in prieſts themſelves, but ſtirreth up God to take vengeance both on Lords and Commons that ſuffer them, it's needful ſaith he, <hi>to be buſie about them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Famous <hi>Wickliff,</hi> alſo bears teſtimony againſt Tythes, prieſts, &amp;c. who (as the Hiſtory declares) had by his doctrin, born ſo large a teſtimony againſt the proud, covetous, oppreſsing generation of prieſts and perſecutors in his days, that they greatly perſecuted him, whilſt he lived, but by the power and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God was preſerved to dye in his bed, and ſo not being able to reach his life, they proceeded to judgement and condemnation of his Books, and certain articles they had collected againſt him; ſome of which were, that he held, that Tythes (or tenths) are pure alms, and that the pariſhoners may, for offence of their Curate, detain and keep them back, and beſtow them on others, at their own will and pleaſure, and that the prieſts are bound to get their living by the labour of their hands, and he that gives any alms to them is accurſed, or in danger thereof; againſt whom the rage of the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors was ſuch, that 41. years after his death, they digged up his bones and burned them.</p>
               <p>Much more might be mentioned of theſe and others of the Martyrs and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men of God, who in their ſeveral times ſuffered grievouſly, manifold tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and miſeries, and loved not their lives unto the death, bearing teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for the Lord, againſt the corruption in doctrine and practice, of the prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of <hi>England,</hi> and particularly againſt Tythes, and ſwearing at all. And ſhould I but mention all that is there recorded, and how they ſuffered im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, yea, death it ſelf, bearing teſtimony againſt ſwearing upon a book, and ſwearing at all, in any caſe, in any wiſe, by the creature, or by the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and againſt Tythes, and covetous wickedneſſe of prieſts, Curates and Vicars; time would fail me, and what I have ſaid may ſuffice for a taſte. And by it may <hi>Richard Fowler</hi> and his Elders be tryed, yea, may try themſelves, in whoſe ſteps they are, and whether they are one with the Saints and Martyrs of God, who were evilly entreated, impriſoned and perſecuted by the wicked

And whether, in honeſty, <hi>Richard Fowler</hi> and his people ought not to deny and diſclaim the Martyrs, and juſtifie their perſecutors, or elſe repent, and own the ſhame of their preſent practices, which by the teſtimony of Martyrs is condemned? And if <hi>Richard Fowler,</hi> thinking to excuſe himſelf, ſhall pretend it was not he, that formerly was not free to take a pariſh charge, to be maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Tythes, nor voluntary contribution from thoſe that gave it grudgingly, and accounted perſecution a grievous thing in the Biſhops dayes, from him onely to be ſummoned to their Courts, though by them he was not impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that hath committed this villainy aforeſaid, but it was his two Elders, <hi>viz. Richard Holliſter</hi> of <hi>Cop-hill,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Prigg,</hi> that have done it; and that he by Indenture hath let them his Tythes. I ſay, if he thus plead, then is the wickedneſs of his heart, and the naughtineſs of his ſpirit, the more made manifeſt, who being convinced of the badneſs of the work, was aſhamed in it to appear himſelf, and yet would put others upon the doing thereof. And for him to pretend the letting his Tythes by Indenture, is horrible deceipt, and the prieſt and the Elders are not wiſe, who in their own declaration put into the Court, have ſaid, the Leaſe bears date the 17. day of <hi>March,</hi> 1656, when as the <hi>Subpoena,</hi> by which they ſummoned the aforeſaid perſons was da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted long before; ſo that either his zealous Elders and proſelytes were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining and perſecuting their neighbours for Tythes before their Indenture was made, or they had that ſhew of a title, or elſe <hi>Richard Fowler</hi> himſelf was the man that did it, of which being aſhamed, he afterwards for a cloak, makes a pretended Leaſe to others, or rather the Prieſt with the Elders and people of <hi>Weſterleigh,</hi> conſult and agree to perſecute the innocent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſupplication was made that they might be ſent for, and commanded to ſwear how may eggs and apples were due to <hi>Richard Fowler,</hi> which they in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to Chriſt refuſing to do, for whoſe name ſake they ſuffer; preſently ſolicitation was made, that power be given to caſt them into priſon, as it was by the wicked <hi>Caldaeans,</hi> to caſt the three children into the firery furnace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becauſe to the Lord they ſtood faithful, &amp; did not bow to that to which by the command of the Babyloniſh King, they were required, and ſo the Scripture is fulfilled, and the Devil hath caſt ſome into priſon, where being faithful unto death, they will receive the crown of life in the approaching day, in which the cruel Beaſt, the falſe Prophet, and thoſe that make war with the Lamb, is to be caſt alive into the lake, and tormented for evermore.</p>
               <p>But hath <hi>Richard Fowler</hi> done honeſtly, or as he would be done unto in this matter? If yea, why then did he cry out of violence and wrong, of grievouſneſs and perſecution, when by the former perſecutors he was much more tenderly dealt withal, and not commanded to ſwear to accuſe himſelf,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62941:44"/>nor was ever impriſoned for refuſing thereof? And would he not have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted it a vile and a moſt wicked thing in the Biſhops and their generation, if they by their means and intereſt, had not onely caſt him into priſon, but his family out of doors, uſing all means they were able, ſo unjuſtly to ruinate, ſpoyle and undo him in his outward eſtate, whilſt they kept him in bonds, and that for ſo ſmall a matter, as a few Tythe-apples and eggs, &amp;c. unjuſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded? If ſo, why then doth he allow himſelf in the practice of that which he condemneth in others, ſince God is no reſpecter of perſons?</p>
               <p>And were it not good for him, to remember, from whence he is fallen, and repent, and call to minde what himſelf hath ſpoken in my hearing, in many of his Sermons, made in the former perſecutors dayes, from theſe and the like Scriptures, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.37. <hi>O Jeruſalem!

Yet, at length, growing great, &amp; in favour with the world, and embracing the ſame, became as vile perſecutors as any of the reſt, under whoſe bloody ſpirit the innocent ſervants of God, who ſtood faithful to him, ſuffered very grievous tormentings: And how <hi>Rich: Fowler</hi> is degenerated, may be ſeen, who once cryed out grievouſly of perſecution, which himſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, yet hath occaſioned, and doth occaſion the ſervants of God at this day, to ſuffer manifold more than himſelfe endured by the Biſhops, and that upon the ſame ground, and for the very ſame things, for which the former ſervants of God did ſuffer by their perſecutors.</p>
               <p>And did not he know, or believe, that <hi>Richard Holliſter, Richard Atwood, Henry Alſop,</hi> and <hi>John Champneys,</hi> could not in conſcience ſwear at all, before he occaſioned that requeſt to the Court, that they might be ſent for and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to ſwear? And if ſo, then whether himſelfe with his Elders did it not, to enſnare and betray the innocent? And whether in this he is like a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of Chriſt? Or whether in it both himſelfe and his Elders are not one with the wicked Preſidents and Princes of <hi>Babylon,</hi> who ſought an occaſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Daniel,</hi> which the Reader may read, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>All which at preſent is left to the conſideration of thoſe therein concerned, till another opportunity by the wiſdome of God, is adminiſtred, for laying o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the wickedneſs of this generation, of which this is but a little, onely let all the world take heed and beware of a generation of deceivers and falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <hi>who come in ſheeps cloathing, but inwardly are ravening wolves,</hi> who by their fruits may be known; they are greedy dogs that can never have enough
